"POSITIVE", "In today's world, laptops and netbooks are treated as disposable computers. In my experience dealing with laptops/netbooks I've never owned one that was able to handle much more than and internet browser and sometimes could barely handle that because they were so burdened with background processes to function. Google got it perfect for people who only need to take a laptop around to surf the web and use google docs. It is completely silent due to no moving parts, starts up in seconds, simple user settings interface, and all I have to do is open and close the lid to resume and pause my work. I can also watch Netflix without any lag at all. The touchpad is one of the best I have ever used. And the pricetag was perfect! I was able to get the computer, case, and one year accidental damage warranty for a grand total of 281 dollars. I prefer netbook style over tablets and for the money, you cannot buy a better quality netbook than this."
"POSITIVE", "Fast, light, good battery life."
"POSITIVE", "+ Great keyboard + Fast boot/wakeup + Thin & light form factor + Excellent battery life"
"POSITIVE", "Boots quickly. Crisp display. Lightweight. Absolutely silent. Barely even gets warm. Battery life is very good."
"POSITIVE", "that was good computer i like the keyboard its good for babe"
"POSITIVE", "Quiet Easy to set up Looks like my Macbook Air"
"POSITIVE", "very lightweight, battery life is awesome, small ac adapter, quick boot... overall great! yes it runs netflix JUST FINE!!!"
"POSITIVE", "it's thin portable fast .samsung brand"
"POSITIVE", "Boots up super fast since its an SSD, Really speedy when browse around online, keyboard and touch pad is really good for its price. Battery life is very good, Lightweight, and doesn't feel hot when its use for a very long time."
"POSITIVE", "-Highly portable -Great battery life -Good screen brightness -Easy setup -Simple to use -Great price"
"POSITIVE", "Wow! Awesome to have it this Samsung Chrome book just so simple to log in and on the way to go! Wi-Fi have no problem to me and the battery still use for a back up at least 6 hours the most. I bought mine in amazn with a cheaper price for $219.00. Great price! and ship within 3 days the most at no charge for shipping plus with a gift too! Great to have it."
"POSITIVE", "This product's usability is based on how committed you are to using Google's systems. Before I bought this I had an android phone, used gmail, and regularly used many of google's applications. So this made my transition to this machine seamless. I think that helped, because I didn't have to learn anything or start using something new. This Chromebook is under $250. Think about that. It is a internet browser machine. And that works for me amazingly well. My interest in this Chromebook was to purchase the smallest most compact laptop that was the most affordable. I have a homebuilt gaming pc that is my work horse for everything, but I wanted mobility for some little tasks. This thing is great. IT's small, the hardware is great, the battery holds up, it feels like a much more expensive system than it is mostly because there is minimal software, and it is very simple. It is light, and plastic, but that also makes the arguement that it is not precious. If this thing fails, or is stolen off the subway, it is not a huge investment, and everything on it is most likely on the cloud already. I didn't think I would start using this as much as I do. I missed a traditional laptop. I have a tablet and a Galaxy note 2. But it feels pretty good to use a laptop to browse and type and operate. It is a great in between from the phone/tablet and desktop pc and it is so affordable. This should be the future for mobile computing. Every desktop owner should have one of these to bridge the gap of mobility that a PC lacks. This serves as a 90/10 split. My PC has all the power and utility, this has mobility and ease of use. It's too cheap not to try, I really enjoy it."
"POSITIVE", "With a gmail account, setup is instant...great for my kid starting high school. They 'require' it, but will furnish for those that can't get one. Anyway, we bought one and with home wifi and the school's, as well as other free hotspots it's hassle free, fast and plenty of storage on google drive for documents and other media to be stored and/or worked on. Great syncing too, because whatever work is being done at school is synched and can then be easily opened at home on our desktops with google drive...great so far! Also, my personal opinion is that having an accessible keyboard is just icing on the cake...a powerful tablet with a keyboard really."
"POSITIVE", "Fast, simple, easy, long battery life, decent resolution vs size."
"POSITIVE", "I really did not think I would like the Chromebook as much as I do. It is very lightweight, fast, has a long battery life, good sound, connectivity, etc. I can do about 90% of what I use a computer for and about 98% of what I use the Ipad for. For the price I really think this is the best option out there for what it does."
"POSITIVE", "Its a Chromebook! Small and compact. Pretty screen. Netflix, Hulu, interwebz, music. I bought it for when I am on the go. Works perfect for me"
"POSITIVE", "- Fantastic battery life - Exceedingly light - Keyboard feels great - Quicker than expected - Impressive build quality for the price - Linux awakens this machine's true potential - Runs quiet and cool - Built-in speakers are impressive"
"POSITIVE", "Easy initial setup. 100 gigs free storage from google drive if redeemed online. Will be for my daughter's high school since they require students to have a Chromebook. Can use/stream Office 365 apps (word, excel, power point, outlook if you have an account with Microsoft Office 365. Along with Google drive can use Skydrive as alternative storage for device. Can't go wrong with Samsung quality...they just do it right."
"POSITIVE", "-Setup time is about a minute or less -Boot time from shut down is about 10 seconds -Boot time from sleep mode is instant -Google Drive (docs) acceptable replacement to MS Office -Spotify, Netflix, Hulu, Youtube (even 1080p) work flawlessly"
"POSITIVE", "Fast, easy, convenient, maintenance-free. All the functionality I need in a non-gaming machine."
"POSITIVE", "Samsung Chromebook has to be one amazing machine, life battery, small easy to use, there is so much that I can say about this and I mean a lot, I would have given this Chromebook a perfect 5 since it pleases my academic needs, except that I am about to say in the cons, please read carefully."
"POSITIVE", "I am largely thrilled with my Chromebook, when I need to get productive with my writing and detach myself from the comforts that lead to distraction, this machine is perfect. Chrome OS loads incredibly fast, there are many very useful apps to be found in the app store, fantastic price and the suite of services Google offer makes this a great budget computer. Battery life is fantastic and build quality is surprisingly solid. The keyboard is accurate and very comfortable to use and I fell in love with the touchpad."
"POSITIVE", "Lightweight, charges quick, battery life is quite impressive, boots up super fast! My wife upgraded to this from a Gateway Netbook and she is super happy, the Wifi works soooo much better with longer range."
"POSITIVE", "Works great for my girlfriend surfing the internet (Facebook,Pinterest) Its light weight, Battery last long time, Boots fast."
"POSITIVE", "Bought this for the wifey. She isnt doing anything that needs a lot of power, so this was great. We are a Google household already, so this fit right in. It plays video quite well."
"POSITIVE", "The Samsung Chromebook by Google is a fantastic product. For the price of a Tablet, you get a well-made product with a keyboard, USB Ports and great battery life. Screen is bright and wide. Footprint and appearance very Mac-esque. Perfect StarBucks appliance."
"POSITIVE", "Excellent. Very light. Durable. Battery lasts forever."
"POSITIVE", "very fast I really like the keyboard battery life is the best I have seen so far very lightweight thinner than any other screen is bright"
"POSITIVE", "- Fast boot time - Apps - App store - USB 3.0 - HDMI (out) - Bluetooth Cant really explain my joy over this laptop. Its amazingly fast. You really get what you pay for... if anything its like giving $249 and getting $500 in return. The hardware is great and made for what the laptop is suppose to be used for."
"POSITIVE", "Small, thin, light, 6.5 hours of battery life, nice keyboard, large touchpad, good screen. Google Chrome OS instead of Windows 8 Metro! The charger is small and light too. Fanless and quiet. Boots very quickly. Plays YouTube videos just fine. Oh yeah, and all this for the great low price of $249."
"POSITIVE", "Awesome battery life Great keyboard lightweight fast boot up"
"POSITIVE", "Cheap, but you get what you pay for. It's also lightweight, so there's that."
"POSITIVE", "Cheap and easy to use."
"POSITIVE", "I love these chromebooks, this is the 2nd one I've owned before this I had the Acer C7. First off you have to be aware of what you are buying, this will not be like any laptop you have ever used, infact this won't be like anything you have ever used. This is just a web browser through and through, with apps. The laptop is more current now so more then ever, with 'cloud computing' becoming a huge thing in the market, Chromebooks are literally made for cloud computing. This laptop is inexpensive, but fast, it starts up in under 4 seconds, and then your browsing the web. Microsoft office 365 works perfectly with this device, or you can use google docs if your professors don't mind it. Now you can't install microsoft office, but by paying the 10$ a month fee, you can use the full office suite on microsofts 'skydrive' and there is literally no difference between it and the install able version. Spotify and Rdio both have web players that work great for the chromebook, not to mention the chromebooks own media player. Netflix works amazingly, I like it a little better then on normal computers to be honest. Steam has a web based chat program with notifications that are fully compatible with Chrome. As does most other instant messengers. The HDMI out is a really nice little thing that I did not expect to ever find on these laptops, that make them all the more useful for netflix. The keyboard is the best keyboard I have every used, worked can't really explain it but the keyboard is top notch, I wish google sold them separably so that I could use it on my main build. The mousepad is really sensitive, and easy to use after you get use to it (see cons) The laptop never gets hot, the battery lasts for hours, the SSD speeds this thing up like nothing else, the USB 3.0 is a nice addition for those who want an external harddrive. The screen is really nice for the price of this laptop, decently bright, and is good for what you need it for. I have not had any lag with this yet, I had 30 tabs open and not one problem."
"POSITIVE", "I like the Samsung Chromebook. Very light Inexpensive Very quiet Nice keyboard layout Good screen Plays videos well Boots up and wakens from sleep very fast"
"POSITIVE", "1920x1080 HDMI output works great, battery life excellent, multipul account logins, Netflix works great, whats more to ask for the great price?"
"POSITIVE", "THE choice for the average computer user. If you essentially use a computer for social media and Google apps, Chromebooks cannot be beat. High quality hardware and software pieced together to provide a fantastic and inexpensive web consumer experience."
"POSITIVE", "Awesome battery life! Easily hits the promised 6.5 hours, depending on usage. I'm a student, so I basically just have WiFi on, moderate brightness on Google Docs for a few hours a day. At home I'll use it for YouTube, Google Play Music, reddit, facebook, etc. Those uses eat up battery a bit more. It performs almost perfectly for all these things, except occasionally YouTube. Some tweaking and I got it running generally how I want it. Keyboard and trackpad are great. The two-finger right click is intuitive and hard to not try to use on my Windows laptop. Side note: I hardly turn on that hunk of junk anymore because most things I want to do I can do on my Chromebook, and it does them better. For the $250, there is nothing better for my purposes. Chrome OS made me realize how much I can really live in the Cloud or already did. Don't have Netflix myself, but it is updated to work on Chrome OS now. Xfinity (which uses Hulu) works just fine."
"POSITIVE", "-Screen is great. People have been saying viewing angles are off and the colors are washed out, but comparing it to my MacBook Pro, it's a little dimmer and a little washed out but not nearly as bad as I had expected from reading other's reviews. -Instantaneous boot/wake up -I cannot stress enough the great build quality. If I had to describe it in one word it would be 'Sturdy'. You can pick it up by one corner with no flex. The texture on the hand rests is good, trackpad is very large for such a small netbook, and the keyboard is no stress to type on and the tactile feedback is decent. -Obviously, price -Battery life is very good -Exynos 5 is faster than expected, resulting in no fans and minimal heat, just what I needed -16GB of internal storage plus 100GB Google Drive is more than enough -Offline capabilities are good -Design is clean, takes cues from MacBook Air (see hingle gripe) -Inlaid Chrome logo (not printed)"
"POSITIVE", "Great PC for casual Web surfine and streaming, can have more then one tab open with no problem"
"POSITIVE", "So I have had this bad boy for about 6 months. Zero problems. Its perfect for going to class with, watching Netflix, and just surfing the net. Its super fast and get the job done. I'm so glad I spend 250 instead of 1000 for a laptop that does the same thing. Buy this product you wont be disappointed."
"POSITIVE", "simple, easy, lightweight, fast, dedicated Chrome buttons, keyboard, boot speed, GOOGLE."
"POSITIVE", "Perfect compact size but large enough that I don't find myself wanting a larger screen. Good battery life. Great keyboard and trackpad. HDMI output works perfectly. SILENT operation."
"POSITIVE", "Nimble, Boots Fast"
"POSITIVE", "It's a great idea! If everything you do is on Google Chrome, this seems like an ideal solution (and it is, for a while). The system boots up quickly and you login using your existing Google account. All of your existing Chrome extensions and apps automatically pop up, there's no going around and searching for stuff to install."
"POSITIVE", "Fantastic computer, does exactly what I need it to do. -light -boots quickly -edits documents and LaTeX -great keyboard -loooong battery life"
"POSITIVE", "Boots up fast... Keyboard is good Thin Fast when browsing the internet (sometimes)"
"POSITIVE", "MacBook Pro Battery Life Cosmetic Look"
"POSITIVE", "Very fast. You can never go wrong with the Mac OS! Such a drastic change from Windows. There are no BSOD to worry about!"
"POSITIVE", "They seem to be built solidly and The OS has been rock steady. I had a laptop with Windows 8 and it was a nightmare. Constant BSOD and program freezes leading to frustrating reboots. I had been using PCs for over 25 years and I put up with a lot of hardware and software glitches for too long."
"POSITIVE", "great product runs good have not had any problems with MBP like i said loving it but they could have givien 8 gigs of memory stock it would not have hurt"
"POSITIVE", "runs smoothly software there isalotout there just have to know where tolook"
"POSITIVE", "First, as a perferred customer with Newegg, shipping was fast and free! Second what a great computer, easy setup, with in the first evening of ownership I had transfered all the my files I needed from my old computer and was working with my MBP as if I never missed a beat. GOOD-BYE MICROSOFT!!!!!!"
"POSITIVE", "I usually upgrade MBP yearly. This is smooth and even faster then my previous 15inch. Feels lighter and much faster"
"POSITIVE", "It works fine,"
"POSITIVE", "Coming from an Octo-Core Custom build desktop loaded to the teeth with crossfire 6950's and SSD...etc I decided to make a change to the MAC Enviroment more as a learning experience as being a PC Technician I prefer to know the framework of all environments I'll have to work with and face whether its windows 7(8 beta), Linux, or OS X. Though the specs seem humble it packs a punch and delivers well. Plays most main stream games on at least medium to high such as Civilization V, TF2, SC2, and Stronghold 3 to name a few. As far as claiming MAC's can't play games... check out STEAM for that. Overall though the transition has been nice with a quality machine that you will love. Also running a external monitor for dual-screens in my setup has worked just as Win 7. -Great Battery Life(4hours or so in games) -USB 3.0 works like a champ for moving files but unlike eSata, firewire, and thunderbolt it has the same form factor as almost 99% of most products out there and can accommodate to"
"POSITIVE", "I've been very impressed with ASUS as a hardware company having bought everything from netbooks, motherboards, routers, network cards, and even optical disk drives from them. This ultrabook seems like a great value, and the build quality with its metal enclosure would have been much better than most barring some major hardware issues."
"POSITIVE", "This machine has a nice form factor and has an RJ-45 network port which is why I purchased this over other ultrabooks. Also the price is quite competitive."
"POSITIVE", "In my quest for an affordable Ultrabook that has similar apeal of the ASUS Zenbook this is the way to go. i5 3317u @ 1.7ghz with Turbo up to 2.6ghz!! Upgradeable ram slot. 4 gig DDR3 1600mhz sodimm on the way. Reinstalled Windows 8 to the 24gb SSD itself. Windows rates the SSD at 7.4 WEI vs 5.9 with the HDD as the primary drive. After all the installing I have over 6 gigs of free space even after updates. Don't worry guys if you really want to install a bigger Msata SSD you can because it has its own slot. If space becomes an issue I will install a bigger SSD. I think this is a huge Pro to this Ultrabook is the ability to have a large HDD and upgrade the Ram and the msata ssd. The touch screen works amazing and you can turn it off if you want in the USB Human Interface Devices in Device manager. The screen isn't as horrible as people have been complaining about. I have no issues with the brightness or reflections. Its 110 degrees here in Texas so you wont find me out in the sun checking my email. Even with bright light coming from my windows I have no issues seeing the screen or functioning the ultrabook. I even got this open box and I am completely satisfied. I needed something more powerful for the ability to play games at low resolutions and settings on the go. The HD 3000 graphics on my i3 wasnt cutting it BF3 at lowest res and settings wouldnt play at all. on the HD 4000 I can play BF3 multiplayer on low settings at 1024x768. HD4000 is just enough to have acceptable gameplay. For the large screen hd gaming thats what my 3770k / sli setup is for. Having just enough power on the go is possible with this ultrabook. After questing through gaming laptops like sager, alienware and msi gt I realized that really hardcore gaming is for the desktop beast rig and all laptops will get super hot and not perform as well as a gaming desktop rig in most cases because there is just no way to contain and transfer all that heat away for reliable cooling. So having this ultrabook is just enough for me to take my games places when I have to and have plently of juice for anything."
"POSITIVE", "Small, light, powerful for an ultrabook, inexpensive"
"POSITIVE", "Lightweight and slender."
"POSITIVE", "solid body, good ergonomics, touchscreen, classic keyboard layout, properly aligned touchpad for touch typists. good autonomous work time"
"POSITIVE", "Light, thin, fast, and looks good."
"POSITIVE", "Stylish and Elegant Design. Great Price."
"POSITIVE", "None"
"POSITIVE", "Looks great, runs fast."
"POSITIVE", "Portable but full featured with a decent battery life, even when on high power"
"POSITIVE", "I research many webpage for almost a year before buying my next laptop. I research Sony, Acer, Toshiba, IBM Lenovo and Asus Notebooks. At first i wanted just a notebook for gaming, but then i realize how much more valuable and useful where ultrabooks. To be honest, this is neither the lightest ultrabook nor the thinnest. The major contenders where the Toshiba U845/U945 with Blue aluminum finish, Acer M5 Series Aluminum finish, Lenovo Yoga, Asus Zenbooks series, Asus Vivo Series and Sony ultrabooks. Let me state this clearly, no ultrabook seems to have it all, at least not right for everyone. Some have touchscreens, some backlit keyboards, some optical drives or SSD drives. Keeping that in mind, some features are worth more than others for people depending on their needs or desires. However the Asus vivo book excels in many of its features. Pros: - Chiclet Keyboard, very nice response -I5-3317U Processor 1.7ghz -4gb DDR3 1600mhz/ Free Memory slot -14.1' LCD Touchscreen -24gb SSD Cache, Fast -3 Usb Ports (2x 2.0 usb and 1x 3.0 usb) -HDMI Port -Battery life approx. 4-5 hrs -Sonic Master speakers ( Incredible sound, really good and loud) -Touch pad is very good, detect 4 finger features."

"POSITIVE", "It's light, thin, and....that's it."
"POSITIVE", "This laptop is portable, stylish and fast. This laptop is perfect for college or anyone that needs to have portability but also have the performance."
"POSITIVE", "Unlike a few other reviews I think the screen is decent. I didn't expect a much higher end display at this price point. The i5 seems to keep up OK but again not completely blown away."
"POSITIVE", "Got this a month ago and it shipped fast. stripped off the bloat antivital and added 4 g of extra RAM. added office 2013 , wish I would have done the new office 365 . This PC starts up fast and does it's job , wife loves its light weight and touch screen"
"POSITIVE", "Nice looking, touch screen"
"POSITIVE", "Price and quality are top-notch! Great performance for the price! If you're getting a laptop with Windows 8, the touch screen is an absolute must."
"POSITIVE", "The biggest benefit of this notebook is the touchscreen. Running Windows 8, a touchscreen is a necessity. ASUS' touchscreen is extremely accurate and handles multi-touch gestures well. Even better is the track pad. ASUS put their own software for using the track pad as a multi-touch gesture device. This makes navigating and using Windows so much easier. The most useful gesture is a two-finger tap which acts as a double click. The screen is what others say, 'poor,' but for me it's perfectly fine. It's HD and I can't complain about it. The keyboard is easy to use. I previously owned a TF101 tablet, so the keyboard style is the same and I adjusted to it immediately. The webcam on the other hand is somewhat poor, but I did not purchase this notebook for a webcam so I am fine with that. The I/O ports are excellent for my use. I have expandable storage with USB ports, display out with HDMI and a port to hook up to a projector. Overall, this is an excellent valued keyboard for the money. Perfect for students, or those who use a computer for simple tasks everyday."
"POSITIVE", "This is a nice book! Considering the payoffs/sacrifices you'll make to stretch your dollar. This is my first laptop! I've been hardcore on desk top systems because I like a screaming, sick system! Since I'm back in school, I needed a good stable system and a sturdy frame for it. ASUS has never betrayed my expectations. They've disappointed me a few times over the years, but then again, so has my Mother and I still love her, too. Sleek & sharp & high quality workmanship. The Core i5 is more than what I need for its purpose. The touch screen is super responsive and I've got a better idea for what Microsoft was hoping for with Windows 8. It also came with Office 2013 loaded and they give you a free month right off the bat. It's nice and this laptop handles it with ease. Not ONE issue since I've received it 2 weeks ago. Cold Boot takes about 35 seconds. Warm Boot or from Sleep maybe 7 to 10 seconds."
"POSITIVE", "So far (2+ months at time of review) this has been a great purchase. You really cant go wrong; build, touchscreen, great specs. Intel HD4000, SSD combo HD is a great compromise in space/performance. A quality product from ASUS which does not disappoint."
"POSITIVE", "Nice keyboard. Nice Hardrive Space. Touchscreen Abilities."
"POSITIVE", "I just have this laptop for less than a day, but can't wait to write a review. This is an awesome laptop. The design and build quality are astonish. Sound quality is clear and much loader than my old laptop. Touch screen is sensitive and smooth. Battery seems can last 4-5 hours for light use. running video over 3 hours. AC adaptor is stylish and unique."
"POSITIVE", "Touchscreen! Excellent battery life. Touchscreen! Quality Construction. Did I mention that it has a Touchscreen?"
"POSITIVE", "Fantastic for video editing, photoshop, and every day tasks. Touchscreen is incredibly responsive and superb"
"POSITIVE", "Solid build quality Multi-touchpad works great Stylish 4-5 battery life"
"POSITIVE", "touch screen! classic keyboard layout -- big advantage proper touch pad position centered to B key good overall ergonomics and look"
"POSITIVE", "I own this, but didn't get it from Newegg (sorry guys, was able to get a much better deal with a NYC outfit this time around). I previously built a Hackintosh using Newegg components and really started to like OS X and the Apple ecosystem. I then decided to get a Macbook - but which one? The Air is an amazing machine, so slim and light. But I'm used to building things and tinkering with them. Enter the 2012 Macbook Pro. By getting the lowest 'base' version, it opens up a great opportunity to expand. First, you can upgrade the 4GB RAM to 16GB. Most of the major memory manufacturers will sell this for around a hundred dollars. Second, you can swap out the 500GB drive for a SSD. I went with a 256GB model and it flies. I'm getting over 300MB/s writes and around 500MB/s reads. SSD cost was under two hundred dollars. Third, you can swap out the optical drive for a second hard disk. I put in a 500 GB Scorpio Black. Even with full drive encryption I'm getting 62 MB/s writes and 74 MB/s reads (was getting close to 90 unencrypted). Total cost including the drive, the optibay adapter on your favorite auction site and an external caddy for the DVD drive was under a hundred dollars. Total time to upgrade everything, including cloning the SSD from the original HDD, probably a couple of hours tops. So, for around four hundred you're getting a configuration for a lot less (Apple's configuration including a max of 8GB and a 256GB SSD, but NO optibay drive is $500 more). Why is this possibly the last, great, cheap (relatively speaking) Macbook Pro? The retina models coming out now no longer have upgradable RAM. The SSDs are a lot harder to swap out, and whatever storage you have on the SSD is pretty much it. With my config I have tons of space on the SSD for program files and important docs, and run Parallels images and music files from the second HDD. The CPU is sufficiently fast; I've never felt bogged down (especially with the SSD upgrade) and Parallels runs any Windows apps I need like a champ. Note: Newegg often runs deals on Parallels."
"POSITIVE", "Looks good, feels well built. Screen looks nice (though I prefer matte finish). Hardware is pretty good, runs most things without a problem. Nice keyboard, nice trackpad. I honestly liked using this laptop, until..."
"POSITIVE", "Coming from a 17 inch Windows based laptop the smaller form factor is awesome for travelling, which I do a lot of. I've owned other Apple products in the past, including an late 07 Mac Mini and Macbook and several iPods and iPhones and I'm nothing but impressed by this product. I initially bought my wife the base 15 model which she loves.. My Windows laptop was failing so I decided to order the 13 inch to try out. I've debated between returning this machine and going bigger but I love this form factor. Performance is awesome on the base 13 but I think overall for price and longevity the 15 might be a better option. I bought a base level 15 for myself to compare this weekend, I bet that the increased performance from a Quad i7 and discrete graphics might sell me on the bigger machine. Either way I love Apple computer products.. Fast, reliable and well built."
"POSITIVE", "Overall, an excellent machine. It's lightweight, the fan is absolutely silent in all but the most taxing of applications. The battery life is stellar at 7+ hours. It rarely gets warm to the touch at all (during 'typical' use, such as web browsing or desktop publishing, it stays cool to the touch). Graphics performance is actually pretty impressive. The HD4000 Graphics are miles ahead of previous intel offerings. The magsafe connector is fantastic, no more broken charging ports for me! I can never go back to a laptop without a backlight keyboard again, what a handy feature! Mac OS is incredible. Windows is such a chore to use now, once you've been spoiled with the OSX experience."
"POSITIVE", "Cheap, very fast, quiet, immune to viruses, good for email, web browsing and homework."
"POSITIVE", "Hey its google after all and im a huge android fan."
"POSITIVE", "Cheap Simple Relatively fast for most internet interactions"
"POSITIVE", "Perfect laptop for web browsing, Facebook, Google+, YouTube, anything that you want on the web. Simple, Light-weight, boots FAST! And each update it gets better!"
"POSITIVE", "light, fast, easy to use, simple, long battery, perfect for school or chilling on the couch. almost silent. keyboard is solid. touch pad awesome. screen is 1080."
"POSITIVE", "This is a great computer for both basic web browsing with Chrome OS, as well as more advanced work with Ubuntu. Installing Ubuntu was very easy. This computer has a very high performance to power consumption ratio since it uses an ARM processor instead of Intel. I saw a benchmark test where this computer was more than twice as fast as an Intel Atom-based netbook. Unlike other reviewers, I have not had any issues with the display. Sure it's not as good as some of the more expensive laptops, but it is good enough for watching videos."
"POSITIVE", "Portable."
"POSITIVE", "This device has the easiest and fastest set-up of any other technology I've purchased in the past. The best way I can describe it is really a cross between a tablet and a laptop minus a touchscreen. I also love how light and compact it is. I think it will be great for travel and for school. The keyboard is also great for the size of the laptop. There is plenty of room to type without cramming your fingers together. Not to mention the price is awesome."
"POSITIVE", "Long battery life Slim size, light weight Good keyboard and trackpad Chrome OS is always up to date"
"POSITIVE", "Fast bootup. Nice sized keyboard. Lightweight. Excellent integration with Google Applications. Strong WiFi. Good battery life. Touchpad is large and effective - took me a while to get used to tapping with two fingers to 'right click'."
"POSITIVE", "nice looking, relatively easy to set up"
"POSITIVE", "Still running strong without a hitch. Stays crazy stable and temperatures are always cool even after hours of gaming. Beautiful screen."
"POSITIVE", "newegg forced me to write something here. I don't have any pros to offer however."
"POSITIVE", "**Radeon HD 8750m** (A dedicated graphics card of this level for 500$??? - Decent overall performance - Good bang for buck - Played CS-GO with about 50-100fps on med-high settings. Seen videos of the 8750m playing CRYSIS 3 pretty smoothly on the 13.8 beta drivers.... THATS VERY IMPRESSIVE. Go youtube it, aint no joke"
"POSITIVE", "Pros: -good overall performance -dual graphics is good -gaming on almost all games at the highest settings except for current 2013 ones -3.7k benchmark 32 fps min for FFXIV if anyone wonders"
"POSITIVE", "fast gaming laptop/desktop replacment. the matte screen isn't as grainy as some might complain about. download Asus backtracker if you want to make a recovery USB drive, no DVDs allowed anymore due to the file system. I expected fans to kick on high during gameplay, but was as quiet as can be. excellent build quality and stability. after through testing everything on laptop is stable and relatively cool."
"POSITIVE", "Super fast and the specs on this is top notch. I was able to install 1 game while 2 others were running! Deff. Worth the price if anyone likes gaming on the go."
"POSITIVE", "well its a beast. so far its destroyed everything i threw at i cant wait to do rome total war and bf4 screen has great res temps are super low i just love it so far and at this point no probs at all"
"POSITIVE", "It would have to turn on first."
"POSITIVE", "Fast, quiet, great display, a real best. My previous machine had huge overheating problems so it was very important that this one didn't - I don't even hear the fan - it's amazing."
"POSITIVE", "Lightweight & thin"
"POSITIVE", "This is a great product overall, and especially for the money. Here are my perspectives after the first few weeks with it. 1. This thing runs fast - I don't know what other people are talking about who say this thing doesn't run fast enough. HD video runs seamlessly, even if I am browsing other stuff on separate tabs. 2. Start up time is unbelievable. I am doing 7 seconds from off to asking for my password. 3. The 100GB of free Drive storage for two years is easy to activate and works well - no problem with accessing files and docs reads tons of different file formats. 4. The keyboard and trackpad work great. I'm coming from a ThinkPad where I used that nub in the middle of the keyboard, so moving to a trackpad was an adjustment for me - two finger scrolling, zooming in and out with two fingers in Maps, etc. works great. The keyboard is as good as my desktop keyboard. 5. The screen is definitely sufficiently bright enough and hi-res enough, and the matte finish helps. Viewing angles could be better, but I'm not looking to have 2-3 people looking at the screen on this thing at once, so for one person it is great. 6. This thing is totally silent and doesn't get hot like your typical laptop. 7. Installing Ubuntu on this device is easy, just search for Chrubuntu online. It's a nice way to run a Java environment if you need to."
"POSITIVE", "It looks like a Macbook Air. It boots up fast because of its tiny operating system and SSD. It... hmm... can't think of anything else."
"POSITIVE", "Doesn't take up a lot of space and is very light. Good for watching videos or movies on the go. Probably the greatest value netbook you can get at the moment unless you buy something used. The hardware in general is very good."
"POSITIVE", "Super fast. Boot up to desktop is about 6 seconds. The keyboard is great. I was used to a chiclet keyboard on my old 10' netbook and this is much better. The screen is sharp and I like that it is matte and not shiny so there are no glare issues. The sound on this is impressive, did not expect it to be so loud and clear. And best of all, NO FAN!!!! It is quiet and stays cool. Automatic Antivirus and OS updates are superb. No more pop ups that say 'windows needs to restart to update'. Then have to wait for 10 minutes for it to do its thing. It automatically updates when Chrome releases an update and they are applied the next time you restart. No waiting or annoying pop ups, it does it on its own in the background."
"POSITIVE", "Fast cold boot, about 10 seconds. Fast wake up, almost instant. Very cheap. Nice design. Works well for what it can do."
"POSITIVE", "Looks nice"
"POSITIVE", "Inexpensive and does what it intends well. Keyboard and touchpad are not bad at all. Very light and portable. Good battery life. Can dual boot Linux-- awkwardly now and with hope for better support later, but running from SDHC card will be slow."
"POSITIVE", "Nice and small machine. Very solid. Keyboard is very very nice. Runs most applications very well."
"POSITIVE", "Featherweight, battery life, performance. 75% performance of air for 25% cost. Great screen for web content and casual media viewing. Casual and power web users can enjoy the full potential of this device."
"POSITIVE", "This laptop excels on so many levels. Its fast, cheap, portable, doesn't run hot, boots fast, runs ChomeOS, feels well built, and is unique in that it doesn't have an x86 chip or Windows, while still proving a great web experience."
"POSITIVE", "Battery Life, portability, workmanship, usability, ChromeOS just works."
"POSITIVE", "Streams Videos from my Prime @mazon acct vs Netflix Fast, Very Fast Battery Life 6+ Hours Small & Light Perfect for remote support via logmein for my customers 16gig SSD and space to save files locally Dual Core 1.7GHz Processor 2gig Memory Built in Virus Protection"
"POSITIVE", "Light, fast, portable, does what it claims."
"POSITIVE", "The connectivity of this device is impressive given the market niche this laptop is aimed at. I honestly don't know if I'll ever use the usb 3.0, but it is nice to have. The keyboard is great to type on. The browsing is perfectly adequate. The form factor is attractive."
"POSITIVE", "Very clean screen, definitely bright enough. perfect screen size, very light, and stays cool. Computer starts up very fast, and automatically syncs and updates everything for you. I logged in and in 30 seconds it had all my settings and favorites all set."
"POSITIVE", "Small, Light, powers on quickly. Does what it says. The machine is great for just surfing the net. It's very portable and feels sturdy. The keyboard is great. I wish the keyboard was backlit but that's asking a lot from a 250$ laptop."
"POSITIVE", "Long battery life, great keyboard, good screen, handles multiple tabs like a champ. The design of the thing is pretty attractive, and it's light and very portable. No heat, no noise, almost eerily quiet. Considering the pricepoint this little gadget really packs a punch. The construction feels solid but we'll see how it holds up."
"POSITIVE", "Thin, light, cheap, battery seems good, keyboard is good. This thing boots up really fast. 100GB of cloud storage. Runs youtube smoothly."
"POSITIVE", "Thin, lightweight, keyboard, touchpad, ease of use, Bluetooth, USB 3.0, price, 100GB Google drive, fan-less, noiseless, no maintenance."
"POSITIVE", "The device itself is nice. It has a super sleek line and starts up in a flash."
"POSITIVE", "I have a media server on my home network. Can this book play the movies and videos and songs from my media server? (can it stream play)"
"POSITIVE", "Light. Inexpensive. Over 7 hours of battery life with moderate use. Trackpad is good. Keyboard is great. Browser is responsive enough. Secure shell (dev...) works nicely. 100GB of g-drive storage for two years is an excellent premium."
"POSITIVE", "Lightweight, easy to use, great keyboard, less than 10 second start-up, super long battery life (charge every other day)"
"POSITIVE", "Light, stable, simple, fast, reliable, inexpensive"
"POSITIVE", "Great screen, great keyboard, great sound(!), super light, great battery life, very impressed! The ARM cpu is fast, but runs cool and doesn't eat power, so it doesn't need a noisy fan. From hitting the power button to having a log-in screen is 6 seconds, and it only took a few seconds from entering my password to having a usable desktop."
"POSITIVE", "light, fast web browser, cheap, slim, simple, reliable. I'm surprised at how little I can't do with this thing. It seems about as capable a browser as my desktop machine. Some of the reviews said it can slow down after a dozen or so tabs but I didn't really see any issues with about 20-30 tabs open at some times. I guess it all depends on what is on those tabs."
"POSITIVE", "I am switching from a CR48, this is a thiner/lighter/faster version of that, so i am pleased."
"POSITIVE", "Thin, light, silent, works well with WebGL, HTML5 apps. Good flash apps work better than on most netbooks in this price range. HDMI and bluetooth mouse/keyboard support. Very nice keyboard and trackpad."
"POSITIVE", "Could I use a wireless mouse and plug into a large monitor with a hdmi cable?"
"POSITIVE", "Base on the specs of the unit and the quick testing of the SLI. I would say that this is a pretty good laptop for the price. i5 and SLI, both handle games quite nicely. Keyboard is nice, soft and curved. I am not a fan of noisy clacks of the keyboard. Also a big fan of the red accents sprinkled around the overall of the unit. Very impressed. Especially for a mid-high end laptop I was expecting the unit to be much heavier and only to be slightly heavier then my previous Macbook Pro which is also another big plus. Unit is very much portable but with power. Unlike my Alienware laptop I had purchased several years ago and 3 times the price."
"POSITIVE", "Samsung specs are accurate No need for virus/malware apps Automatic updates; improvements over time Long battery life in everyday use (streaming content) Responsive keyboard Cool after hours of consistent usage Access to Google and non-Google services (apps for Hotmail, Skydrive, etc. avail. from Google Web store) Sound quality and video brightness are excellent Free online storage of documents Log on to multiple Google accounts (work/personal) with customized background images, apps, default home pages, etc. Overall value for the price is off the charts"
"POSITIVE", "Nice to have all Google settings transferred seamlessly"
"POSITIVE", "•Portable •Fast •Chrome symbol :) •Apps are nice to have •I like the dedicated chrome keys •Multi-touch pad •Uses Google accounts •And mostly just fast •Amazingly well with overheating •No annoying updates and alerts I have had it for about a month now and overall I'm very amazed at the concept and especially amazed at how well it worked. The specs mentioned are all true and work very well."
"POSITIVE", "its a great little laptop, perfect for just browsing the internet and playing flash games. its def not supposed to be your primary computer and can be a little frustrating when theres no internet around, but thats what youre signing up for"
"POSITIVE", "Essentially instant on from full shutdown. Or just close the lid and it goes to sleep. Awakes instantly upon opening the lid. Light and thin. Good battery life. Great for Gmail and Google Drive. The touch pad is the best I have ever used. The keyboard is touch typing friendly. Comes with Chrome Remote Desktop installed which is great for remote assistance or accessing your office computer. Also has a shell with ssh or use the secure shell Google app."
"POSITIVE", "Perfect for the non-tech user looking for great access Fast. Recommend for quick and easy web and apps are great for most. Sharing Printers is easy."
"POSITIVE", "Usability is great. Good stereo sound from small speakers. Battery life, gets at least 6 hours every charge. Chrome bookmarks sync between the Windows app, an android phone running chrome browser and this device. Remote desktop into the windows PC from this device. The keyboard is nice and very usable."
"POSITIVE", "The keyboard is great. Laptop is small, but not cramped. Portable, since it only weighs 2 pounds! fast boot. You have everything you need in one place! music, photos, documents, ect. Google offers 100gb free storage for 2 years so that's nice! Plus 5gb free that comes with gmail. There are so many things you can do with it that the things you cant, aren't too bothersome. There are lots of apps and extensions for mostly anything you need. Battery life is awesome! I found myself forgetting about my battery often and when I realized that I had not charged in a while, I looked at the battery level and it would be at 52%!!! ;D Yeah like I said, Awesome! Speakers are loud. Camera is good. Another pro, Google play gives you 20,000 song storage to upload for free!"
"POSITIVE", ": I can run World of Warcraft in Ultra mode and get 27 FPS in Orgrimmar. Windows 7 Experience Index (after memory and SDD upgrade): Processor: 7.1, Memory: 7.4, Graphics: 5.9, Gaming Graphics: 6.6, Primary HDD: 7.9. The speakers are not very loud, but they do have nice sound. It is small and light, with the power of a gaming desktop. It comes with 2GB of extra memory (4GB + 2GB) and an extra 24GB SSD (500GB HD + 24GB SSD) ! The battery recharge time is pretty fast."
"POSITIVE", "Size, build quality, backlit keyboard, beautiful IPS screen, core i7, discrete graphics, RAM can be upgraded, HDMI port"
"POSITIVE", "+ Full HD Panel (1920x1080) on a 13' screen makes for nearly invisible almost retina-like pixels. Yes, text is smallish, but you can increase font size to compensate. + Touchpad works well, I have no complaints. I turned off the stupid charms bar edge swipe and use StartIsBack. Nice, Windows 7-ish goodness. + Laptop boots up plenty fast, even a cold boot. I get impatient waiting for a laptop to boot-up just to check something, but this is fast enough that I'm happy. + Doesn't generate much heat, so battery last for hours -- especially if you dim the screen some. Backlit keyboard spoils me, I'll never own another laptop without it. Just love it. + Keyboard is spacious enough for me to touch type, but understand there is no 10-key and the inverted cursor t-pad is smallish. The island style keyboard reduces typing errors and the key throw and tension is good. But YMMV as keyboards are very personal."
"POSITIVE", "Very light and compact--convenient to carry and use. The display is sharp and has a wide range of brightness. Minimal vendor-ware littering the system. The adjustable-brightness (including off) back-lit keyboard is a good feature. I think the sound is quite good for a laptop."
"POSITIVE", "Great display! Everything looks amazing on this 13' display. I previously owned a chiclet sony Vaio, and the keyboard here feels just as good. Some folks have been having troubles with the touchpad, but I've had a solid performance so far. Case/bag delivered with the ultrabook feels strangley of better quality than I expected- which is nice. The body of the ultrabook is solid and feels sturdy. The last thing I want is some $1000 flimsy piece of plastic I feel like I might snap in half."
"POSITIVE", "Gorgeous screen. Light weight. Fast ssd (if you get adata version). Long lasting battery."
"POSITIVE", "I couldn't be happier with this laptop. After seeing the specs of this laptop for the price, I couldn't find another laptop that compared to it. I really like the SLi feature. Makes performance comparable to a 670m and 675m. The 1920x1080 screen is also great. The JBL speakers deliever excellent sound as well. Would definitely buy again."
"POSITIVE", "Out of the box this is a great laptop. Sure you will have to remove the bloatware and tweak Windows 8 a bit to get it running the way you want. After that, this is a blazing fast machine. I have heard of some minor success in installing Windows 7 on this machine, but it involves installing some Chinese-made drivers. So unless you are proficient and have a lot of patience (or if someone makes a guide) I would suggest just sticking with Windows 8 for now. -PRICE!! $900 for something this powerful is a steal. I have been shopping around lately and it was between this an the Acer Aspire with a 640M. I went with this one because it has the SLI. I'm happy with this purchase, and feel like it money VERY well spent. -Keyboard is awesome. As I type this, it feels sturdy and I like the quiet clicks it makes. Thanks for the Numpad. -Easy to swap out RAM (8 screws). -Fast enough processor. Idle temps run about 40c. -Fast graphics card. Can handle pretty much everything I throw at it with some tweaking. Just make sure you're plugged in while you play. -The stock speakers are okay - they aren't terrible. But the speaker jack is in a good position. -The power adapter seems well put together. I like the design of the plug and the cord is long enough to reach a wall unit with some slack on the cord. -The monitor is big and crisp. -Easy to turn up or down brightness/volume. -Has airplane mode to help conserve battery when you're just playing something low power. -The 'UltraBay' is a great concept and works wonderfully. Take out the graphics card to help with power, toss in an optical drive or an SSD and you're set. -It looks like a BAMF. Lots of complements from total strangers. -720p webcam is a nice addition."
"POSITIVE", "HUGE bang for the buck.. 3rd gen i5, 8gb DDR3, hybrid drive... any well known brand ultrabook with these specs would be double the price, easily. Close to 5hr battery life Quality build, solid aluminum frame, nice keyboard, great screen quality"
"POSITIVE", "*Seems like a solid machine in feel and functionality. *SSD is fast, good hdwe specs"
"POSITIVE", "8 gig ram?!? I5? The vid card isint bad either, 1gig ram and when overclocked runs decent."
"POSITIVE", "Solid, all metal body, clear, crisp display, great wireless performance, quiet fans, well laid out keyboard. The design is almost identical to an equivalent MB Air."
"POSITIVE", "Size - The most notable feature, that most of you who are reading this are wanting, is that it is very slim and lightweight. For a 13' Ultrabook, only weighing in at about 3 lbs is a great convenience to me as I tend to carry around many textbooks with me to my classes. Adding a 5lbs laptop to that mix and my back just wants to die. It is the perfect size for taking it around while also having a large enough screen to be productive. Aesthetics - If you've seen any of the previous Zenbooks then you've seen all there is to see, and by this I mean it looks absolutely gorgeous. With its slim profile, metal body and spiral design on the lid, it is a classy looking piece of hardware that will look good wherever you go. They even include what looks like a portfolio folder to sleeve your Zenbook in. Screen - Right away before you even turn it on, you will notice its matte screen. It does an excellent job of ridding the screen of glare so you can definitely use this laptop outdoors. Once you turn it on, colors are crisp and clean. With the full 1920x1080 resolution, everything looks very sharp and it is a great pleasure to use. Some people may be concerned that an HD resolution on a 13.3' screen might be a problem as text will be too small. For me, it isn't a problem as I can still read things clearly and if I do find something too small I can always zoom in on the text to read, which is a very simple task might I add that leads me into... Trackpad - The trackpad, it is generously sized which I definitely enjoy. It is responsive and is definitely usable, however I wouldn't call it the best trackpad I've ever used. Even so, with the added multi touch gestures that are included with the Asus software, it makes up for what little problems it has. Two finger swipes are for scrolling in whichever direction you want. Three finger swipes left and right are for forward and backwards in applications, down to minimize all/show desktop, up to open Aero Flip which I have more to talk about later in the other thoughts. Then of course there is pinch to zoom as well, which makes everything significantly easier to work with if you find something too small to zoom in on it. Other than that, other things to note are the entire trackpad is a single button and is basically a big left click with the exception of the bottom right of the trackpad which is the right click. Keyboard - Fairly standard chicklet key style keyboard, function keys running along the top for all your media and wireless, brightness settings and what nots. If you've used any of Asus' keyboards in the past it will feel very familiar to you and I definitely like it. Arrow keys are a bit small if that bothers you. Speakers - Volume is pretty good at max, they are definitely loud but they definitely won't break any eardrums. Sound clarity is impressive to me, I'm no audiofile so I have much lower standards but they definitely aren't tinny. Performance - I'll get to that in the other though"
"POSITIVE", "The field is EXTREMELY narrow for a combination of: Ultrabook, discrete graphics, and true HD display. It's just this and maybe one or two other options -- laughable."
"POSITIVE", "Great ultrabook if your not super picky like majority of the reviews on this page. No dead pixels, no light bleed, keyboard and track pad are great. No insufficient or cosmetic problems. No overheating and I have maxed everything on here for high performance benchmark speed tests. Overall its a great lightweight, portable machine. I wiped windows 8 clean and installed Ubuntu 13.4 and all drivers work out of box. A couple minor tweaks but that is it. I couldn't be more happier."
"POSITIVE", "Super light. Great screen. Love the keyboard. Touchpad works great."
"POSITIVE", "Works well with linux, fantastic screen, very comfortable keyboard, really great trackpad, LIGHT!, and fairly cool."
"POSITIVE", "the whole laptop is a pro except the windows 8 which im use to windows 7 so its an adjustment oh and ontop the laptop stand thats included! i mean seriously?! all you do is take the laptop foam and cut off the two pieces like the box says and boom there you go! oh and i forgot the dual may i say dual! video cards!!"
"POSITIVE", "I am a new owner who has done some moderate testing with random games, browsing and other tasks. I'm going to be doing some traveling for about 2 months and wanted to take something with me that I could play the same games that I play on my PC. I read quite a few reviews about the i7 version and wasn't fully convinced it was worth the additional cost. Honestly, I think I was right. The games I've played through Steam (Skyrim, Fallout New Vegas, StarCraft, and FarCry 3) have all played perfectly. Off course there was some, and I mean some, stutter. I'm not too much of an FPS addict, but it played everything smoothly where it didn't distract from game play. The i5 and SLI combination work awesomely together. Windows 8 isn't actually as bad as people say. Give it some time, you'll learn it. I can't think of a reason I would spend more money to pick up a copy of 7 and replace it. The hard drive isn't as slow as people say. Or maybe it is. I guess it's relative. Sure, if you're used to SSDs it's going to be slow as hell. I run an SSD in my PC and I didn't expect my laptop to be as speedy. If you need ridiculous speed replace the HDD. As for me, I'm fine with it. Though, I wouldn't mind seeing a smaller HDD with some SSD caching. That'd be my ideal. The screen is full HD and ridiculously color accurate for a even a $1400+ laptop. Easily the best I've seen. The glossy screen is a bit annoying but does provide better color accuracy and contrast...as long as you're not sitting in a room of bright florescent lights. The keyboard rocks. I thought I'd hate it and end up using my standard keyboard instead. Not the case. The keys are comfortable, easy to clean and easy to type on. You can also easily control sound output, brightness and more with ease. And they glow. Boom. Noise? Not much. If it every becomes an issue I'll use headphones."
"POSITIVE", "Great customer service."
"POSITIVE", "Sleek, thin, 4hr+ battery, stretchable to 5hr if properly tempered new battery's charge full/drain full cycle in the first few weeks of use. i5 3317U 8GB ram Intel HD 4000 runs games up to 2011. Skyrim 1280x720, High Texture, no Shadow/AA runs @ 25~35fps (playable) WoW autodetect @ 45+fps 5GB Mix Content File Xfer @ 30mbps (ultrabook average)"
"POSITIVE", "For an ultrabool of the same spec would cost double from name brands. Works fine out of the box and previous review of standby/sleep error can be taken with a grain of salt. Works great and fast off boot and sleep. Skyrim on 1280x720 with high texture no shadow no AA plays at 25~35fps with the i5 turbo autoswitch (great bang for your bucks)."
"POSITIVE", "Nice hardware, good bang for buck."
"POSITIVE", "Sleek, fast, and everything you need from a laptop. Track pad works well with win 8 gestures. Screen is pretty good but doesnt have the greatest viewing angle. Speakers are surprisingly loud."
"POSITIVE", "All aluminum frame, almost same exact specs as a $1,600 MacBook pro. Performance is nearly flawless. Pretty responsive track pad. All other brands with same specs are way higher priced. Keyboard is pretty decent as well. Screen is extremely crisp and clear."
"POSITIVE", "The 1080p IPS screen is simply outstanding, with close to 180° viewing angles both vertically and horizontally. The dual-core Core i7 3517U outperforms many older quad-core CPUs. The GeForce GT 620M is surprisingly fast; it's about 100% faster on gaming benchmarks than the integrated HD 4000. It gets close to 50 FPS in DiRT 3 at 1280x720 with all settings set to high running the built-in benchmark (about 25 FPS at 1920x1080). Here are the Windows Experience Index numbers (Windows 7) Processor: 7.1 Memory: 7.8 2D Graphics: 5.7 3D Graphics: 6.6 Hard Disk: 5.9 The hard drive was another pleasant surprise. The SSD cache makes a huge difference. I wiped out Windows 8 and installed Windows 7. The software that enables the cache was one of the last items I installed, so I got to use the drive both with and without the cache. Windows 7 took 90 seconds to boot without the cache. That time was reduced to an amazing 18 seconds after the cache was enabled. Programs launch almost instantaneously, just like they do with an SSD. I would choose this drive over a 256 GB SSD drive even if they were priced the same."
"POSITIVE", "Nice high def screen. 6 Gig of memory. I7 processor. Mouse touch pad works nice. I set up a W8 for a lady last week and this went a lot smother. There seemed to be more on the desktop to use than there was on her machine. They put a small edge sticking out to get the top open finally. The lighted keyboard is nice. Looks sharp in the dark. Screen is excellent . My USB stick works in this one with no trouble. I had a similar model I could not get the USB port to function all the time. Good machine but not perfect."
"POSITIVE", "Very fast, thin, light and the screen is phenomenal. The HD4000 with quick-sync technology encodes video VERY fast with applications that support it."
"POSITIVE", "Best ultrabook on the market, super thin, super mobile, super light, high quality, its an Asus, really pretty,"
"POSITIVE", "Very Thin, 1920x1080 resolution"
"POSITIVE", "Nice screen (-backlight bleed)"
"POSITIVE", "OVERALL: The specs are obviously fantastic, especially for the price. Quite aside from being the cheapest 650M laptop, this machine has two (and it only costs you the basically useless optical drive). DISPLAY: The display is excellent. Viewing angles are good to very good - I'm not sure if the laptop actually has an IPS panel, but if it isn't IPS/PVA/PLS it's the best TN I've ever seen. KEYBOARD: The keyboard has a nice, solid feel and good action. Travel is nice. There's no 'hidden tray' underneath it to suck up dust, which is a nice touch. PERFORMANCE: Haven't really had a chance to run the gamut on this. I upgrade the RAM to 8 GB of major name-brand out of the box. In my machine at least, Lenovo inserted the 4 GB stick (ie, the larger stick) on the top port meaning an upgrade from 2GB-4GB for the second stick requires removing both. The laptop only has two SODIMM slots, so you're limited to 16 GB which is a slight disappointment given the weight, but not the dimensions. INTERNAL LAYOUT: To get access to the innards you need to unscrew quite a few screws (more than 5, I think the number is 7 or 8) and life the entire rear panel off. It also doesn't like to 'snap' back into place. It was definitely a tense moment trying to pry it out of the 'snap' slots. With the battery at the top and the laptop upside down facing you, the clockwise part arrangement is CPU/GPU1 + Heatpipe (right side), 2x SODIMM Slots bottom right, Wireless card (Intel 6325 if I'm not mistaken) (middle), 1TB HDD (bottom left), GPU2 (left side). The second GPU is removable (Lenovo calls it an 'Ultra Bay' - presumably some kind of advanced technology oceanic/land formation) with a switch on the bottom-center of the laptop that doesn't latch, but is flush with the bottom. It takes a *lot* of force to pry the GPU out of the slot, so while the ease of moving the switch was a little disconcerting at first, I was actually afraid I was missing some screws somewhere before I successfully pulled it out. It *does not* screw in. The HDD is easily and readily user replaceable - there are two screws holding in the 2.5' caddy. The caddy has a 4-screw metal foil shield over it (I didn't remove this, but it looked pretty straightforward). The laptop uses standard mSATA interface, so it's ripe for replacement. Drive comes with an ~25 GB recovery partition, and then ~900 GB of space for you after the install. The slowest overall component in the WEI is the HDD so this one's ripe for replacement. There is only one drive slot in the machine, so you're going to be trading space for speed (but who honestly needs 1TB in a laptop anyways?). EXTERIOR: The lid is aluminum with a nice texture - the texture makes it feel more plasticy, but it definitely is metal. The entire bottom of the enclosure is plastic, SPEAKERS: The speakers really surprised me with how good they actually sound. Much better than expected."
"POSITIVE", "I was looking for a laptop similar to the latest gen MacBook Pro, and finally found this. If I had unlimited amounts of money to spend, I probably would have bought the Mac before finding this. Thankfully, I don't have endless stacks of cash because I would have missed this! Screen: High resolution with a dpi very close to a mac Video: NVidia SLI. It has plenty of power for all the steam games I have on my PC Backlight in the keyboard Windows 8: (I was going to immediately dump 8 for 7 upon receiving this, but after 15 minutes of 8, I love it! Why did I and other people hate 8 so much? Not sure.) PRICE: $899? You have to be kidding me. Buy this now and keep it for the next 5 years. You will save over $1,400.00 buy not buying a mac book pro or ultrabook."
"POSITIVE", "Super fast: i5 with turbo boost, 8GB of ram, Intel HD 4000 graphics, 32 GB of SSD drive and Windows 8 make it a super fast machine. Boot and shut down times are just insane. Not to mention always cool to the touch. Beautiful: What a solid piece of beauty this machine is. And less than 4lbs? Speechless. Not to mention the gorgeous and crisp screen that works exceptionally well even in the bright sunlight (with the brightness cranked to 100%). Other than the AVATAR logo, this machine has no flaw/s when it comes to build quality and looks. I kid. Love AVATAR for creating this affordable wonder. Battery: It depends on the brightness and the power plan you set this beauty at. I for example keep the brightness at around 40% and the power plan at Performance, and still get close to 6 hours out of this beauty. A lot of HD Youtubing, mind you."
"POSITIVE", "- Sturdy and well built. I can pick it up from the corner with the screen open and there is no flex at all. - Keyboard is perfect - Large Multitouch trackpad is great - I was worried about the small power connector, but it is very sturdy and has a nice solid connection - Very fast with the Core i5, 8Gb Ram, and SSD. Resumes from sleep in ~3sec."
"POSITIVE", "It looks cool."
"POSITIVE", "I bought this ultrabook for school because it's light and has enough power to run the programs I need. I was worried about buying an unknown name but it was well worth it. The track pad is okay and the keyboard works great. Very similar to the Macbook pro. Very fast and hasn't overheated on me once. Seems like a sturdy computer and the screen is a good size. All in all, I love it."
"POSITIVE", "Shipped quickly, fast setup, everything connected correctly."
"POSITIVE", "Lightweight, well build, looks great. Runs everything we want, and probably more as stuff comes out. We got this as a replacement for a less than desirable laptop used for gaming. No problems at all yet."
"POSITIVE", "got to my house in 2 days I have had no speed problems it's easy to tweak plenty of fan slots runs planetside 2 with no problems and fallout new Vegas on max"
"POSITIVE", "Runs Anything i throw at it, Was able to adjust the fan speed, Runs GTA4 Etc."
"POSITIVE", "- Works right out of the box, no problems what so ever - Very quiet, along with a nice sleek look and cool LED lights. - Decent GPU, might want to upgrade in the future. Still good. -16GB of RAM.... Well played."
"POSITIVE", "stop looking and start buying!!! you will not find a better system for under $700 read jkteddy77 he sums it up quite nicely."
"POSITIVE", "First, the heat problem people always complain can be alleviated very easily. Turn the power setting from full performance to energy saver. I was surprise how much cooler now my Ultrabook is. Wii is still erratic. Turn off the energy management of the wifi adapter. IT helps some. Nothing you can do to strengthen the reception. The ports are flimsy. SO treat them like virgins. The tracking pad is still not as good as Macbook Air but I dislike Macbook Air'screen. Nice escreen"
"POSITIVE", "Gorgeous display, lightweight, nice keyboard."
"POSITIVE", "Screen, light, portable"
"POSITIVE", "Gorgeous screen, lightning fast boot times, nice keyboard, long battery life."
"POSITIVE", "3dMark 11 results of 6544 3dMarks, Graphics Score 10912, Physics Score 2726 on a Notebook that costs $900. I've tested DOTA 2 and TF 2 with everything maxed and it ran smooth as glass. The speakers are really good and can be used as your only gaming speakers. Not a fan of Glossy screens, but this one looks really good."
"POSITIVE", "Awesome specs for the price of 899. SLI graphics. Fast computer awesome running all games that I've got."
"POSITIVE", "Nvidia gt650m x 2 has played every-game I've tried max settings at 1080p at ease. very solid, nice backlit kb, synaptics touchpad 1080p with nice detail no dead pixels, very nice speakers on par with hp's beats audio and these sound more clear imo"
"POSITIVE", "After using Windows 8 (which I hate) I found that installing windows 7 was really easy. Most of the drivers can be found on Intels website (the wireless is the Centrino-N) look for the file Wireless_15.3.1_Ds64.exe from Intel. The rest was easy to find (including the ELAN drivers for the touchpad). Things to note: Don't bother with the Intel Rapid Storage stuff (I couldn't get the hard drive accelerated anyway for whatever reason). Instead get your windows 7 USB or CD ready and destroy the RAID group. Then go into the BIOS and change it from RAID to AHCI. Then install windows 7 to the SSD drive. Move the page file to the secondary drive (the 466GB drive) and bam the machine screams. Why bother caching when 32gb is enough for the entire operating system? All of the drivers save for the ACPI (which you don't need) are easily found on the web. I have to say, this is the best Ultrabook I have found for this price, and after my install of windows 7, its performance is awesome."
"POSITIVE", "Thin, Light, Keyboard, Speed, Stays Cool, and Battery Life"
"POSITIVE", "Very Thin, Light, Price, Fast, and Stays Cool"
"POSITIVE", "-Sleek -Thin -Portable -Design -Price!"
"POSITIVE", "Light, good specs"
"POSITIVE", "This computer is amazing. It runs allof my games flawlessly and on the highest settings. Whether it's Skyrim, WoW, Fall Out, or anything. I love it. Windows 8 takes some getting used to, but once you do, it's not nearly as bad as what people say. I love it."
"POSITIVE", "Didn't really get to see any..."
"POSITIVE", "For the Price, this is definitely the gaming computer anyone who's looking into gaming should buy -very quiet computer - amazing RAM space - runs all my high end games mostly on high- ultra settings, some video lag on ultra running Skyrim, Battlefield 3, Crysis 3, but meh, it's to be expected. - lots of upgrade possibilities, planning to swap out the GPU and power supply for better ones, and add some liquid cooling + more Fans. :) -Windows 8 is amazing, forget what you see about the negative comments about Windows 8, usually those are the people who don't understand how to adapt to change, but after a day or two, I got used to Windows 8, especially the Start screen and how you can split screen with different programs. I like."
"POSITIVE", "- Very Fast/Responsive - Comes with tuning software already installed so you can monitor your power or overclock your cpu (Although I wouldn't recommend it with this setup) - Clean and simple design - HDMI on video card - Arrived the day after I ordered it and I only paid $10 for regular ground shipping"
"POSITIVE", "none so far"
"POSITIVE", "Light weight. Long battery. Powerful for it's size."
"POSITIVE", "Lightweight, very fast start up from sleep, long battery life, does not heat up like Macs, 1080p. On paper it is awesome."
"POSITIVE", "nothing has gone wrong so far. works as advertised. nice screen. no issues of scratching or fragile ports as others have complained of, though i have been gentle with the unit."
"POSITIVE", "Nice screen. Light and thin enough to fit in my passenger's bag. The extra pixels really make a difference. I had a Macbook Air. Don't get me wrong. I loved the Macbook Air. Mac OS is fun and intuitive to use (and I have always been using PC), the Mac keyboard and trackpad are awesome. I just couldn't get used to the screen resolution, and that was no why I would pay extra $500 for the retina display. $500 for the retina display."
"POSITIVE", "This ultrabook packs an AMAZING screen in a lightweight package with a great keyboard and solid specs. It's not the fasted on the block, but it was never designed to be. It's great for light gaming: just don't expect max specs on the latest games. The battery life seems to top out at about 5-6 hours, which is quite acceptable for a laptop this size."
"POSITIVE", "I'll cut to the chase: the ability to swap components, including a second GPU, is a terrific feature. The dual 650m SLI gives you around the same horsepower as a single GTX 485m/580m/675m (when the 650ms are OC'ed to normal 650m levels) for a far cheaper cost. The design is nice and understated, a good departure for the Xtreme dorm-room, shiny-object designs of most other gaming laptops."
"POSITIVE", "Still running strong without a hitch. Stays crazy stable and temperatures are always cool even after hours of gaming. Beautiful screen."
"POSITIVE", "Outperforms my Vishera 8350 8-core w/ Gtx 770 PC. On sale for 999.99."
"POSITIVE", "Fast, quiet and runs cool. Not a gamer, but wanted a laptop that would do any thing that I wanted it to do. Put a SSD and it speeded up a bunch."
"POSITIVE", "This is a beautiful laptop. Very powerful, plays all games I play with ease on high settings. I thought the sound was pretty good for a laptop. The screen was crisp and could be viewed from the sides pretty well. Brightly lit rooms were not a problem either. It came with very little bloatware, at least in terms of programs. I don't use the Metro side of Windows 8, so there may be lots of bloaty apps."
"POSITIVE", "Great specs, thin and light, works properly."
"POSITIVE", "Design, speed, look, price, internal components."
"POSITIVE", "This is definitely an ultrabook in its feel. It is just a shade under the mac book air in class and feel. In fact at first glance you will confuse the two. It definitly has a sturdy feel to it, and I love the trackpad and keyboard. The specs are better, the intel 4000 HD is a nice inclusion, and played HD videos with zero problems. The usb 3 port is on one side, and the usb 2 port is on the other. They are clearly marked, and positioned well. If you are looking for an ultrabook that is more powerful spec wise then the mac book air, yet half the price this is perfect."
"POSITIVE", "newegg forced me to write something here. I don't have any pros to offer however."
"POSITIVE", "price, size"
"POSITIVE", "nice look"
"POSITIVE", "arrived fast , thanks to Newegg"
"POSITIVE", "Worked perfectly right out of the box. Easy setup that took only minutes. This thing runs so quiet, if it didn't have that awesome blue glow I would forget it was there! And games run perfectly smooth on high settings. After looking through other stores in town for a good pc in my price range, I gave up and looked online and found this monster, and for the same price as most other less powerful systems! This leaves my previous pc whimpering in the corner. I Highly recommend this system to anyone looking for a serious upgrade from their old pc."
"POSITIVE", "I just got this today and it worked perfectly right out of the box. Setup is easy and takes minutes. Shipping across country took 4 days and thats a good thing.. I went to Staples and a few other stores to buy a new pc, and they were out of every pc in my price range, so i took a look online and found this. I guess it was destiny. Compared to my previous pc (hp compaq, 2.5gigs of ram, and 250gig HDD) this is beastly. I haven't tried gaming on it yet but soon will. And for the price...how can you beat it?! It looks cool and runs silent. Best money I ever spent...so far. We'll see in a few weeks of running this machine."
"POSITIVE", "Really solid specs - runs LoL at 60+ FPS on highest settings, handles BF3 on high as well (doesn't quite get there on Ultra settings, but I think that's to be expected), I'm able to output audio to my 5.1 system via the HDMI out on the video card which I wasn't sure was going to work at first. For some one looking to get into PC gaming, this is seems like a good place to start."
"POSITIVE", "Excellent mid/high-range PC. Runs games like Diablo 3, Sanctum 2, TF2, all on highest settings with virtually no lag. Very fast delivery- original ETA was in 4-7 days, it got to me in 3. Huge RAM capacity: I've only ever used as much as about 6 of the 16 gigs I have available. Installation was a breeze, no driver installation required. Large HD space: a total of about 900 gigs available upon reciept. Everything about this computer is a huge upgrade from the one I used to use: this is pretty much my first actual gaming computer, and so far I am very satisfied. EXCELLENT price for the quality; I got it at $630 (not sure what the going rate will be from day to day). Keyboard and mouse are decent, however I recommend an upgrade if you are planning on doing serious gaming. All-around great computer. Highly recommended."
"POSITIVE", "Great laptop, specs are awesome"
"POSITIVE", "amazingly fast, nice display"
"POSITIVE", "Great laptop, runs games amazing. Quiet and the screen is gorgeous"
"POSITIVE", "Very powerful processor, decent video card, backlit keyboard, solid, sturdy design, all at a reasonable price."
"POSITIVE", "..."
"POSITIVE", "Compact & light laptop, slim design and looks good. Price was good for what your getting (suppose to get)."
"POSITIVE", "light weight, decent price, cheaper than a tablet, runs starcraft2 on lowest settings"
"POSITIVE", "Small, light"
"POSITIVE", "Nice weight nice screen while it worked. Dell does not charge for returning the defective computer. (Lenovo does)"
"POSITIVE", "Sleek and light weight."
"POSITIVE", "For the price that I paid I think the hardware is pretty good. I replace the HDD with an SSD. Be aware, that as this is in the Ultrabook style, normal 2.5' hard drives won't fit, you need the slimmer 7mm. I really like the keyboard and touch pad. The touch pad is built into the palmrest, so there are no cracks for junk to build up in. Dell has drivers on their website for Win7 64-bit, so I was able to remove Windows 8 and get Win7 going without any issues. One thing to note, I think the 2-finger scrolling doesn't work as well in Win7, but it is worth it to not have the bloat from Win 8. The aesthetics are definitely a 5. The computer looks pretty sleek. It has not gotten hot for me."
"POSITIVE", "Windows 8 is nowhere near as bad as it is made out to be. After just a week of use, it's more like using Win 7 with a few more features."
"POSITIVE", "I've had this PC for 3 months, and it has run perfectly. -6-core FX 6100 cpu, which isn't amazing on its own, but buy a fan or two, and you can overclock this thing to 4 ghz easy. -GT 640 2gb is a great card for the price. It's about as good as a 7770, but with more Vram. -16GB RAM. will you need it for gaming? probably not, but it comes in handy if you're running a small server. The 430 Elite case is very good, very ventilated, and easily upgradable any future harware, including long GPU's and crossfiring. It's very quiet too. Some game specs (with lowered AA) BF3: Medium settings with Ultra Textures 30-45 fps Minecraft: 190 fps max settings Left4Dead 2: 50-60 fps max settings low AA Sleeping Dogs 40-50 fps high-max settings Borderlands 2: 30-45 fps High-Ultra settings"
"POSITIVE", "Fast six core processor, a great 16 gigs of ram, and a 1TB HDD is more than enough for the average gamer. When I did get a chance to play it, only on Diablo 3, it ran awesomely smooth and high 50-60+ with everything on high at my monitors 1680x1050 resolution. The GT 640 seems like it's a nice card, if it actually worked for me."
"POSITIVE", "I like the color blue..."
"POSITIVE", "nice looking, relatively easy to set up"
"POSITIVE", "The computer is great. Looks pretty, runs smooth, fast, and makes a majority of games look great with the SLI 650M Graphics cards!"
"POSITIVE", "Great price for what you get. Dual GPU’s handle most games at mid to high settings at the screens native resolution. GPU temperatures stay cooler than previous Nvidia GPU architectures I have owned. Keyboard has a nice feel to it when typing. Over all look and finish of the laptop is very good."
"POSITIVE", "High Performance Amazing Build and surface finish Light for a gaming laptop Red backlit keyboard is so cool and the keys are awesome GT650M SLI is a beast at gaming Superbright 1080p screen is so sharp, everything else looks meh Amazing audio output Loud and high quality JBL speakers Really efficient vents and in-takes-doesn't heat up as much as expected"
"POSITIVE", "Smokin fast: Quiet: Amazing machine at $1K. Multi-task with ease. Running WoW Ultra @ 70+ fps . High @70+ Back-lit keyboard is a nice bonus. Solid case with sturdy screen and construction. Zero issues. Just loving this laptop."
"POSITIVE", "It haves intel i7, 12GB of rams, and the graphics card is a GeForce 670 at 3GB wow, that's great wish my laptop had these specs"
"POSITIVE", "I have to say I am really impressed with this laptop. The matte full HD screen is outstanding, the keyboard is the closest I have seen to a Mac, 670MX performance is excellent. Excellent build quality, no flex anywhere. The keyboard surround is aluminum so no fingerprints anywhere. The palm rests are a soft rubbery material which is extremely comfortable. Virtually no heat on the KB even after hours of gameplay. Even at full 1080P gaming, can only hear a faint 'woosh' out the back. This was the first laptop that my wife didn't say anything while at the table (compared to numerous complaints with my former Alienware). Surprisingly can get 3 hours of battery with wifi and fairly high brightness on the screen (not gaming, casual browsing). Win7 drivers! There are Win7 drivers! You can actually have a brand new full gaming laptop without the atrocity that is Windows 8!"
"POSITIVE", "nice looking and seemingly screaming machine"
"POSITIVE", "So far this machine has me impressed. Plays games much better than anticipated. Looks slick, nice speeds, and the screen looks great. So far no problems with the feint lines others have seen. Cooling is amazing as well."
"POSITIVE", "it has a nice screen and very compact"
"POSITIVE", "it was average while it lasted"
"POSITIVE", "I like the keyboard and the touchpad... both respond well... also the bootup time is not shabby, and for me the screen res. is fine. Sound is not too bad."
"POSITIVE", "Nice, light, fast"
"POSITIVE", "Lightweight. FAST boot. 6G Memory! intuitive touch pad. not a huge amount of bloatware."
"POSITIVE", "Fast, this laptop is what I was looking for on speed. 17 inch screen back lit keyboard for the night. Runs all of the games I throw at it."
"POSITIVE", "No idea, cant even get it to turn on, wasnt working right out of the box."
"POSITIVE", "Fast for a notebook."
"POSITIVE", "Sleek design, lit keyboard."
"POSITIVE", "Beautifully designed. Love the speakers sound, design and quality. Windows 8 Stock Drivers do not do this justice. Immediately put on 7 Ultimate and installed drivers from lenovo site. (Dolby Surround). Full Backlit keyboard has two modes of brightness in red. Great feeling keys too. Display has beautiful range in color. 6GB of Ram is the minimum requirement for me, just enough to get by for the next 4 or 6 years. CPU is comparable to i7-2670QM (last notebook had this) runs just as good if not, better. 720 Camera looks great! Dual GPU is more than I need and I like it that way. Coming from a GT 540M and just one 650M is more than enough for me. Light gamer, mostly playing Super Street Fighter IV AE. May look into if it's possible to box up the 2nd gpu into storage for future use if the 1st GPU were to go, as long as they are the same fit. Maybe throw a SSD in it's place."
"POSITIVE", "* Fast i7 processor * 3 GB of dedicated video memory (Plays games with demanding video process with ease) * 12 GB of RAM (Clearly more than what most computer users need) * 17.3' display with a resolution of 1920 x 1080. * Computer boots up in 10 seconds or less. * HDMI Output is an excellent feature so that you can plug it into a TV with HDMI Inputs and use that to play movies or video games on a bigger screen."
"POSITIVE", "This laptop is a monster. The overall speed of the machine is unbelievable, the cooling system is most effective as well as near silent, the editable levels of backlighting on the delightfully Chiclet keyboard are so nice, the screen’s matte finish is very nice (I am not experiencing the dreaded vertical lines plaguing other owners), I enjoy the effect of the brushed metallic finish lining the keyboard, the sleek yet rigid, inspired and classy overall design. Arguably the most controversial feature of this model is the Operating System. I have been a PC gamer my entire life, have gone through the xp to Windows 7 transition, and I cling to my desktop like a child to his blanket. However unlike most of my kind, I find no fault in windows 8. In my humble opinion, it is doing its best to suit the needs of two very different (but at the same time similar) consumer markets. I still have my beloved desktop, I still have my file system, and I get this weird cool-ish “Modern UI” to toy with. (However with Windows 8.1 I will definitely be booting to desktop )."
"POSITIVE", "Very good at gaming"
"POSITIVE", "none"
"POSITIVE", "It was cheap given hardware configuration"
"POSITIVE", "nice overall system, have not had any problems with router disconnects i have read from others."
"POSITIVE", "Very nice computer - very well made. Aluminum body. Lightweght. Great quaility. Works perfect while on Ethernet cable."
"POSITIVE", "Battery Life, smaller and lighter than macbook pro."
"POSITIVE", "At least the laptop is light for its cost."
"POSITIVE", "Build quality is excellent. Backlit keyboard is great, would never buy a laptop without one. Speed is excellent, 5400 RPM drive does not hold the system back much. 12GB ram is a sweet spot, not too much disk swapping with this much ram. HD screen is excellent. 2 second resume from sleep is literally 2 seconds. I mean, I open the lid, log in and the computer is responding to commands immediately. How they did this is beyond me. Although the fans do run, you don't hear them at all. The MSI gaming laptop will wake up the dead from the fan noise. The trackpad is SUPERB, nice and big, supports full gestures. I thought I wanted a touch screen but this is way better."
"POSITIVE", "Expected great ASUS quality and that is what I got. Computer feels very durable. Plays every game that I needed it to. Cooling system is as good as I expected. After doing a lot of research on this series I went with this computer because it was the best in my price range. Almost everything negative I could find about this computer and the current series (G750) seemed to be related to software/Windows 8 failures. Every problem I encountered while using this computer was resolved with updating drivers or tweaking something in Windows 8. Only two things remain unresolved. (see cons) --Accuracies that I will not consider cons but need mentioning: ---Weight - Although i understood this was a heavy computer, It still shocked me once it was on my lap. This is a heavy computer. This is not the computer you should buy if you are planning on commuting with it. ---Windows 8 - You have heard its bad. I thought, well those people don't have the technical knowledge I do. Windows 8 is extremely laborious. It seems that in order to do anything, you must complete two extra steps before your task is completed. Something as simple as adding a shortcut to your desktop takes longer than it should. I bought this knowing what I was getting into and it was not as bad as it could have been. I honestly feel that once drivers and software update enough to work out the bugs, Windows 8 will be a decent alternative to Windows 7. Not a replacement. Not to mention the first time Windows 8 restarted to install updates, it took 3 1/2 hours before I was allowed to shut down the computer. This computer is very quiet. Even fans running as loud as I could get them could not easily be heard. Back lit keyboard is nice but there is quite a bit of light bleed from under the keys. This was my first back-lit keyboard so I'm not sure if this is a con or not. I have nothing to compare it to."
"POSITIVE", "Lots of features."
"POSITIVE", "The SLI comes in handy. I love the backlit keyboard it helps a lot for gaming at night. I have no complaints about this nice laptop. For $1000 its a hell of a machine."
"POSITIVE", "It is fast. I can play Skyrim on ultra settings. Sims 3 is a little sluggish, but really it's no worse than my old desktop."
"POSITIVE", "This is my second review of this laptop after owning it for several months now. As almost all the other reviews state, this laptop is an amazing gaming laptop for the price. This alone gives it 5 eggs. Another huge aspect of this laptop that I have come to realize is its work potential. I have two HP z620's that run windows/linux for my development at work. I eventually became tired of needing to remote into those machines to get any kind of work done from outside the office. I decided to toss those machines back to IT and use this laptop for everything I do in life (game/work/anything else) and it does it all. I put a 128GB msata SSD in as well and run my linux VM's which just scream. This laptop can take advantage of the hardware acceleration for your VM's so you get full video performance in Ubuntu/Mint on a VM running on this Windows 8 machine. In all, I could not be happier with this purchase. This is for the serious gamers on the go... or serious developers who need the computing/graphics power."
"POSITIVE", "This laptop is absolutely incredible for the price. I'm running TF2 with all graphics high/very high, dxlevel 95, 1080p and AA 4x and I rarely dip to below 60 fps even in an intense firefight. Everything is always smooth. Movies have an awesome picture and crisp. The speakers sound wonderful."
"POSITIVE", "Great screen size and battery life. The laptop performs perfect for gaming and visuals for video editing."
"POSITIVE", "none"
"POSITIVE", "great screen, decent battery life considering it's screen size. boots up pretty quick for a standard hard drive"
"POSITIVE", "Fast and very nice looking."
"POSITIVE", "solid laptop easy to use"
"POSITIVE", "Excellent specs for the price. Slap a SSD in this baby and it screams!"
"POSITIVE", "good price"
"POSITIVE", "Not sure yet."
"POSITIVE", "This review was created after I owned this laptop for 33 days Windows boots up relatively fast with the build in 5400rpm hdd. Good size hdd. Very little pre install scrapt software."
"POSITIVE", "Light, sets up quickly, good price,"
"POSITIVE", "Quite a lot. It's probably easier to list shortcomings. :)"
"POSITIVE", "i like the overall look and design. Relatively easy to by-pass Windows 8 start screen with Pokki or other start app of your choice. Runs cool, whisper quiet, i've not done any significant gaming as yet; however in comparison to my HP dv7t which would quite often be hot as .., the ASUS has not even become warm and have had no audible fan noise. Comes with 2nd disk drive cage in the HD bay, had to buy as extra accessory for HP dv7t."
"POSITIVE", "Decent battery life for a notebook with these high of specs. Backlit keyboard. With a few upgrades rather fast. Decent video card, stays cooler on my lap than my old laptop, fans are quiet and blow out the back. Windows 8 isn't so bad now that I've gotten used to it. Dual drive bays make it easy to upgrade and the open RAM slot is easily accessible. It handles photoshop and video editing with ease"
"POSITIVE", "This machine screams for gaming, I have it hooked up to a 46 inch TV along with using the monitor. I play many different games but no matter what games or graphics you want to run this thing runs cold and quiet. I liked this unit so much that I bought two and upgraded my wifes computer. If you want a gaming computer without the tower this thing is the only way to go."
"POSITIVE", "Powerful laptop with great specs."
"POSITIVE", "This is the fastest notebook you can buy, once you install an SSD. Graphics and display are awesome. Dual drive bays are awesome, allowing you to run the OS and applications from a fast SSD while carrying plenty of storage in the other drive bay."
"POSITIVE", "From the second I started it up the display impressed me quite a bit. Sharp, high resolution, it's like eye candy. It's fast, that's the best way I can put it, especially for a laptop. This thing is absolutely gorgeous, the pictures do it no justice. I've no problem running games like Metro, Skyrim, TF2, all at high graphics with no lag. Overall, if you're going to spend a thousand bucks, I'd say this is a good way to do it."
"POSITIVE", "Dual graphics, high resolution, red backlit keyboard,"
"POSITIVE", "powerful graphics for gaming good heat dissipation"
"POSITIVE", "The very first Pro I can think of is 650Sli. Not many laptops/notebooks have the OPTION* to install a 2nd GPU. I say option 'cuz you can also buy, from lenovo's site, a Blue-Ray bay or another fan. That's VERY nice. The 2nd is 1000Gb... Even tho the HDD spins at 5400 RPM you cannot feel the diference. It runs so fast and smooth. I havn't had any issues what so ever running at 5400, Besides loading games. It does take a little longer. Another pro is Win 8... While maybe people hate it, I like it after customizing it. Adding some key features to make it just like win 7 but with the win 8 advantages. Yes, it does run smoother then win 7 IMO. Backlight Keyboard is nice, and the sound is VERy GOOD! You will love it."
"POSITIVE", "Dual graphics, lots of RAM, 1080p screen (also a con)"
"POSITIVE", "well this is one of the best laptop i have ever owned.......well it pretty beefy in spec and can handle all games and everything else. play all the game titles with no problem all setting on hight or ultra. loving the matt screen which alot of the laptop manufacturer nowaday fail to do. u can play for hour without ever worrying about heating because the exust is awsome. and keyboard is by far the best i have ever seen.... beats msi steel series keyboard in my opinion."
"POSITIVE", "This is a quite powerful laptop that I bought for my birthday to use as a backup since I don't always don't want to have my workstation on all the time... With this laptop, I am able to run Modo and Zbrush on this with almost no lag. I also run Unity, which is used for game authoring and some of my my scenes run smoothly. Haven't played anything heavy on it yet to really push it, but I think Crysis 3 and BF3 will run well. I also like the fact that the laptop has a matte finish which won't show too much dirt and it easy to clean. I also added a Seagate Momentus XT at 750 and my boot time is snappy. -- I also love the backlit keyboard... so no more worrying about not being able to see the keys at night."
"POSITIVE", "I don't know yet... I'm not going to use the thing until my screen is fixed. I took it out of the box the day I got it and immediately sent it back to Newegg. After I got it back from Newegg, I sent it to ASUS, after I got if back from ASUS, I sent it back to ASUS again... Currently waiting..."
"POSITIVE", "Great Screen, Keyboard and Mouse ( some what ) Performance is great, the internals of the machine are great the new intel graphics 4000 is fantastic."
"POSITIVE", "First, let me preface this by saying that I have great experiences with Dell Laptops. You have to keep in mind though that some units are made with less quality than others. This is typical of the first Netbooks that came to market, in order to keep cost down they had to cut some of the costs on higher quality parts etc. to meet the price point. With that being said, this is not even the case on this laptop. This laptop is amazing, it is playing Starcraft 2 and handles multimonitor like a Pro. I have a huge 24inch HDMI monitor hooked up and it has no issues whatsoever with HD movies or the game running. Now, with that being said - this will not play those games on Ultimate perfectly (which is completely understanding as this is not what a portable notebook is for) but it still manages to keep up and make the game playable even at Ultimate Settings. I love the simplicity design and the keyboard is great. The unit has Bluetooth and 3 USB 3.0 ports, an HDMI output and card reader. All ports have cover on it when not in use, which is a great feature for a portable notebook. Unlike what other laptops have, I think this gets a very decent battery life. I get 4 hours of constant use out of it, and that is not even the power saving modes. It has a 500GB Harddrive, it has 6GB of RAM and a decently fast boot-up time. It is ready to go in a matter of seconds from shutdown to turn on."
"POSITIVE", "Fast Fast Fast. Great Video Card nice Ram ammount GREAT COOLING Price"
"POSITIVE", "Screen size, lay out, hardware in general"
"POSITIVE", "Great laptop for any entertainment purposes whether gaming or audio. Very nice slick design considering its 17.3' body. Will run most games on decently high settings. Touchpad is very responsive as opposed to others."
"POSITIVE", "everything everyone else has said about this laptop is true. Love this thing, i has handled the below list of games at high/ultra high settings: GW2, METRO 2033, The Witcher 1&2, Dead Island, Crysis 2. Win-8 is not bad. If you do your research, you can default to a classic Win-7 look. There are 1000's of tutorials on you tube."
"POSITIVE", "Bang for the money"
"POSITIVE", "Throws any game I throw at it on high - maximum (including final fantasy 14, Skyrim, GTA 4)"
"POSITIVE", "-Handles all my games on high settings flawlessly. -can't beat the power you can get out of this laptop. -it's a laptop...... Portability"
"POSITIVE", "Solid Laptop for the price Viable as a Gaming Laptop (SLI is integrated well and cooling is not as much of an issue) Purely sexy cosmetics (the pictures do not do this laptop credit at all) Nice built in sound for a laptop"
"POSITIVE", "The specs for the price point are very good. The laptop has a very clean look, and the rubberized exterior is nice touch. The keyboard is high quality, better than many run of the mil laptop keyboards. The keyboard is also back-lit, and has 3 levels of dimming. I love that the fans venting out the back have removable filters that can be easily cleaned and replaced. A second hard drive bay is available for an SSD or more storage. High res screen looks great, and the finish is not glossy (great for gaming)."
"POSITIVE", "A beast of a rig for a laptop, plays modern games very well at high settings and resolutions. Fast boot up. Solid design and construction. Backlit keyboard, good vent design, etc."
"POSITIVE", "Excellent specs for the price. Runs everything you can throw at it effortlessly. Very nice screen. Installed a 60G SSD as Win 7 64 OS Drive and second 256G SSD for programs. Wonderfully fast!"
"POSITIVE", "Coudn't tell you"
"POSITIVE", "None that I can list at the moment"
"POSITIVE", "Breathtakingly gorgeous… Love the high resolution 1920 x 1080 stunning display."
"POSITIVE", "Screen is fantastic when it doesn't have backlight bleed all around the bottom edges."
"POSITIVE", "On the whole, the machine is fast, and I love how light it is. I didn't want something I felt like I was lugging around, but needed something more functional than a tablet. This fits the bill on all of those fronts. I was debating between this and an Acer, and while both are great laptops, I chose Asus from what I've heard about the build quality. I am glad I did. I like that it is aluminum on all sides. While I wouldn't want to drop anything on it, I have faith that this will stand up to the grad student grind. The screen is quite nice as well."
"POSITIVE", "Great system for the price."
"POSITIVE", "Base on the specs of the unit and the quick testing of the SLI. I would say that this is a pretty good laptop for the price. i5 and SLI, both handle games quite nicely. Keyboard is nice, soft and curved. I am not a fan of noisy clacks of the keyboard. Also a big fan of the red accents sprinkled around the overall of the unit. Very impressed. Especially for a mid-high end laptop I was expecting the unit to be much heavier and only to be slightly heavier then my previous Macbook Pro which is also another big plus. Unit is very much portable but with power. Unlike my Alienware laptop I had purchased several years ago and 3 times the price."
"POSITIVE", "nice looking, relatively easy to set up"
"POSITIVE", "Still running strong without a hitch. Stays crazy stable and temperatures are always cool even after hours of gaming. Beautiful screen."
"POSITIVE", "newegg forced me to write something here. I don't have any pros to offer however."
"POSITIVE", "1080P, SLI Graphics, Back-lit Keyboard, good laptop speakers. Did not seem to contain the bloat of 3rd party software that I have seen in the past."
"POSITIVE", "-Love the 1080p display -650m SLI can really smack around games that have decent multi-GPU support -Looks beautiful, much more classy than the pictures can convey -1TB of storage? Sounds good to me -Monitor overclocked like a boss. Running a nice 75hz (+25%) refresh rate nice and stable. Seems like it can go higher than 75 too, will try pushing it further later -Can be even more capable for gaming if you unlock and overclock. See Other Thoughts"
"POSITIVE", "I'm not going to comment on the performance; you can look at the specs and figure out what you're going to get out of this thing. I just wanted to say two things: 1) This thing is well built, and by that I mean very sturdy. The hinge for the screen is smooth. 2) This thing is WAY prettier than the pictures show, which made the backlight on the keyboard look tacky. Instead, the backlit keyboard is gorgeous, and the red on the speakers is an extremely subtle, dark metallic red. This is a very attractive laptop."
"POSITIVE", "I like the computer. Everything about it is right for me but Windows 8. I was going to buy this computer but when I saw that disgusting tile feature I decided to put my money someplace else. Sorry"
"POSITIVE", "Everything about it is nice, if your going to spend this much on a computer you should know what your buying and what it can actually do. You can look at the specs and know it's a nice computer, it's really heavy, not really the kind of thing you want to be carrying around to ne honest, it's really heavy and it's got a high price tag. I just keep it next to a desk charging all day and when I need it just move it to the chair next to it and put it in my lap. To be honest it's a nice laptop, I knew what I was buying and I'm happy I bought it."
"POSITIVE", "Very decent performance in games, runs very cool, looks nice. My notebook especially has a somewhat study build quality. Typing on the keyboard is very comfortable but again, not everything is perfect (Look below) Nice backlit keyboard as i first mentioned."
"POSITIVE", "I was wrong, I'm the guy who posted the '1 egg review' The laptop is good, just get rid of McAfee...it shuts down the laptop after a complete scan...no way to change that setting McAfee+windows 8 = ahhhh run for your lives!!!! so in short get rid of McAfee!!!! Everything else is 5 STARS(EGGS)"
"POSITIVE", "It's fast but extremely faulty"
"POSITIVE", "Excellent construction. Screen is amazing (and matte); it is crisp and bright. The keyboard is very responsive. Touch gestures mostly work well. The sleeve provided is classy and robust. Very quiet when doing basic tasks like word processing. Fan is barely audible when doing more intensive tasks. Super portable. The battery gets me about 5 hours of normal use on high performance mode (65% brightness - for a room with lights). I was worried about performance, but I needed not worry. It handles MATLAB and Visual Studio just fine. Simulink loads in about 13 seconds, where as my desktop (SATA III, Agility 3 240GB, 4Ghz i5) loads in 7 seconds. So the transfer speeds on the SSD might be a bit lower, but that could also be processing overhead. I can't tell if processing time is longer, but I usually only work with smaller systems <10 ODEs. 'rlocus' plots do take a second or two longer. There are a few Windows 8 games, and they run great and are pretty fun."
"POSITIVE", "Very sleek and powerful and a stunning gorgeous screen"
"POSITIVE", "Light, great resolution, plenty of power for your average computing (no gaming for me, just media, word processing, spreadsheets, QB)."
"POSITIVE", "Lightweight while still being a powerful computer."
"POSITIVE", "Light weight, fast, sleek."
"POSITIVE", "**Radeon HD 8750m** (A dedicated graphics card of this level for 500$??? - Decent overall performance - Good bang for buck - Played CS-GO with about 50-100fps on med-high settings. Seen videos of the 8750m playing CRYSIS 3 pretty smoothly on the 13.8 beta drivers.... THATS VERY IMPRESSIVE. Go youtube it, aint no joke"
"POSITIVE", "Pros: -good overall performance -dual graphics is good -gaming on almost all games at the highest settings except for current 2013 ones -3.7k benchmark 32 fps min for FFXIV if anyone wonders"
"POSITIVE", "This handles WoW just fine (the reason I bought it). I can keep graphics on Good settings (Low/Fair/Good/High/Ultra), and view distance Fair or Good, and get 25 to 45 FPS. This includes in raids and battlegrounds. I know most people want 60 FPS but you can't even tell really unless it is 17 or lower. It looks just fine. I am also very impressed/surprised that this laptop doesn't get hot. It gets warm, for sure. But I have played WoW for 4 hours straight and still it was only warm, not hot. For less than $600 this is thing has some muscle and brains. I am really happy and relieved."
"POSITIVE", "big keyboard,big screen, good processor, lots of HDD space, windows 8 it really easy to get used to"
"POSITIVE", "Cant Say I paid for the EXPRESS SHIPPING and acording to the tracking # my computer has been running around in a city 250 miles away trying to be delivered to a company that is closed."
"POSITIVE", "The backlight."
"POSITIVE", "-Nice and fast -Illuminated Keyboard -Dual 650m Graphics Cards -Stays cool under heavy load -Backlight LED/ LCD screen"
"POSITIVE", "Great gaming laptop for the right price, 1 TB, beautiful keyboard LED light, etc"
"POSITIVE", "The laptop like stated by the others has a SOLID build. I use the laptop with an external monitor so 'fingerprints' isn't a big deal to me since the laptop will be spending most of it's life on the desk in the corner. The laptop's screen to me is one the biggest cons. It's bright, colors are great, black is good and rarely and back light bleeding. The keyboard is solid and the red back light really shows you and other people that this laptop is made for gaming and 'powerful' you could say. The weight is rather heavier than most laptops, but that's to be expected from a multimedia laptop. There is not any bright LED lights that blind you during night use and the back light also has a dimming feature if you find it too bright at night. Battery life is sub-par, since it is a gaming laptop you can't expect much. The lenovo always on USB is great for me because I use it to charge my phone when the laptops off, it also seems to me that charging my phone takes a shorter amount of time while using the USB port on the laptop. The new ultra-bay is really innovative and probably will be something that other laptop manufactures will probably consider in there future models. The ability to upgrade/change parts from an external slot with two simple switches is so easy that anyone can do it without having to worry about damaging the unit. I really think that anyone in the market for a high end laptop at this price range should definitely buy this. It's well worth the money and more than future proof. I've played games such as Battlefield 3, Tomb Raider, Crysis 3, and the laptop handled all of the games rather well on mixed settings. Not MAXED, but the games look awesome!"
"POSITIVE", "Boots Windows 7 super fast without Asus's 'Instant on' tool. Haven't run any benchmarks yet, but very pleased. Runs cool & quite, great screen. Love the keyboard & touchpad. Very Solid Construction."
"POSITIVE", "Very fast. It's taken every game I've thrown at it and run it at max settings without much effort. Amazing cooling. Exterior of the laptop hasn't even risen above room temperature. More than enough memory and processing power to handle running multiple VMs (not important for most laptop users, but I do development on mine as well). Others have commented on build quality, but mine seems to be very well built."
"POSITIVE", "This thing is fast... The Core i7 is a killer CPU and there's almost no heat coming from this machine. Excellent blend of materials Nice LED backlight keyboard Extremely nice quality 1080p matte finish screen A very solid keyboard and touchpad"
"POSITIVE", "Fast, quiet and looks cool. Dynamic power control settings enable you to tweak just about everything to maximize battery life."
"POSITIVE", "Mechwarrior Online doesn't drop below 24fps, even with every eye candy enabled. Skyrim runs flawlessly. NFS: Most Wanted is the same. Keyboard is quite comfortable. Every game at 19x10 native resolution and there's no stutter. Detected my old OCZ Vertex II SSD without any fuss. Above all, the cooling solution is effective and quiet. Not gaming desktop 'quiet,' I mean near church mouse levels quiet."
"POSITIVE", "Lightweight, low profile, super fast, backlit keyboard, useful trackpad gestures, beautiful screen Design is perfect for my intended use"
"POSITIVE", "Lightweight, very sleek, beautiful screen, powerful enough for engineering software and gaming."
"POSITIVE", "For performance it rocks.. The GPU runs all of my games on medium settings. This of course kills the battery life but anything with a GPU will. I have been planing on swapping out the 5400 HD for a SSD but from what I have seen online. Most SSD's will use more than 2.5W..."
"POSITIVE", "-Fast -Decent video card -Sleek and durable"
"POSITIVE", "The large screen is bright and clear. The WEI data got a 7.4 for CPU and RAM speed. Business graphics had a WEI of 5.6 and the gaming graphics got a 6.6. Of course, the little spindle drive, got a 5.4 index score. This is very good for a notebook in this price category."
"POSITIVE", "Size, Graphics Card, Fast,"
"POSITIVE", "very large, exactly what I needed for design workspace. Also great for gaming. Plays both Portal 2 and Wow nicely, sure it will play others on good settings."
"POSITIVE", "Fast, mobile and everything in between"
"POSITIVE", "Great Screen Pretty fast Not as heavy as it would first appear from the size"
"POSITIVE", "Build Quality is great Graphics Performance for the money is outstanding Keyboard is nice Everything runs great, even the 5400 RPM HDD runs just fine, an SSD would be great, but I am very please with the current HDD."
"POSITIVE", "Amazing graphics performance, easy to upgrade, runs Windows 8 extremely well, and great speaker sound!"
"POSITIVE", "1 terabyte storage, 650m SLI. Backlit keyboard. That's it"
"POSITIVE", "Great build quality, great internal ergonomics for upgrading, great upgrading potential, and great game performance."
"POSITIVE", "Screen, Graphics performance, keyboard, weight, metal, build quality, synaptics mouse pad, usb 3.0"
"POSITIVE", "i7 that dynamically overclocks to handle load, 12 gb of ram, gtx 670 - this thing is fast. It plays every game I throw at it on high - Battlefield 3, Alan Wake, Crysis 2, Skyrim, etc. I gets 2.5-3 hours of battery life on average."
"POSITIVE", "The specs are very good for the money. I needed something lightweight with long battery life, but it also had to have more than 4GB of RAM to run multiple VM's. This was one of the only ultrabooks to fit that bill and stay under $700. The build quality is amazing and it stays fairly cool even under stress. It comes out of the box with a 32GB SSD stick set up as cache... like some of the other reviewers, I easily installed Windows on the SSD using a USB drive and set up the 500GB HDD as a data drive. Still have 10+ gigs left for programs on the SSD also. Overall, I am very pleased with this unknown brand. I will update my review If I run into any issues down the road."
"POSITIVE", "Guy trying to help me was very nice and pretty quick to replay. So, despite a poor product they at least TRIED to deliver. RMA process was very quick."
"POSITIVE", "Very fast, clean lines-very sleek, extremely light"
"POSITIVE", "There are so many pros for this product: -Price -32GB Cache -Thin -Great Processor -No Bloatware -Good battery life -Nice Screen Brightness -Win 8 -2-finger scrolling"
"POSITIVE", "This is a really thin, stylish laptop. The i7 and dedicated graphics card have been great for gaming and watching videos. The full HD screen is really sharp, and it actually looks larger than my 15.4' screen laptop. As with other ultrabooks, it's very light and portable. Some other reviews mention that there's a lot of flex in the keyboard, but I don't see it. I find it really easy to type on, despite the keys being flatter than on a notebook."
"POSITIVE", "* Thin, light, quiet, powerful, and pretty. This is the best tech purchase that I've made in years. After upgrading the ram and hard drive I can't imagine a better system in this form factor. I can play pretty much any game at reasonably high settings and can do all my development work on this machine."
"POSITIVE", "This is my very first owned laptop, must say I am in love with it. To the screen size, power, graphics & memory. I know just the basics in regards to tech, but my friend who is a major in this field was the one who told me to get this laptop & was actually jealous when i let him use it himself. The laptop stays cool on your lap, it comes in handy when doing large projects for school or work. You wont regret this buy"
"POSITIVE", "17 inch screen. i5, 6gb ram. dedicated graphic card. doesn't get hot"
"POSITIVE", "Enormous Size Hardware Specs Got an amazing deal on Newegg for it Multitouch trackpad Palmrests that don't get too hot."
"POSITIVE", "I needed something for gaming while I'm in AIT and this laptop is the best Price/Performance laptop you are going to find. After doing some quick research on hundreds of mobile GPU's (thankfully we have benchmark lists) I found that the GT 650m's in SLI are one heck of a find in a $900 laptop. they can match or beat the graphics options available in laptops that cost $1500 and up. so far I have run: battlefield bad company 2, maxed out 4X AA WoW, Ultra settings league of legends, maxed out Diablo 3, maxed out except for AA Tera, Maxed out Not the most demanding games but they all run with no lag at maxed settings. 1080p screen is nice to look at. Backlit keyboard is awesome for when i'm the only one awake in my room. Chiclets style keyboard feels nice and is easy to type on. Very quiet. I can hear the PS3 behind me spinning the disk. It doesn't get nearly as hot as people claim. I thought this thing would give me burns but i can game on it while it sits on my pillow with no fear of fire. The I5 does a fine job of playing my games. I7 version is available if you feel you need the extra power for $150 extra."
"POSITIVE", "Lots of RAM (8GB would have been nice, but 6GB is still plenty,) fast processor, beautiful screen with a great resolution. They backlit keyboard is great in low-light situations. The 5400 RPM drive it comes with is actually surprisingly speedy. I love Windows 8, so that's a pro for me, though I wish it had been the pro version. Despite the list of cons below (which are all extremely nit-picky,) this laptop is an excellent deal and a superb product. I would recommend it to anyone in need of a mid- to high-range gaming laptop."
"POSITIVE", "Sleek design and build Compact Light Snappy little machine"
"POSITIVE", "Everything was exactly what I wanted. I loved it. It ran smooth, and let me do all the things I wanted too. It is a great buy for the actual specs."
"POSITIVE", "Great computer for the money. got it at $550 and a few days later went up by a lot. Great keyboard too and overall very happy for the stuff i need to do. really looks like macbook air runs very fast"
"POSITIVE", "The HD Screen and lighted keyboard. Nice shape and color. Despite other reviewers problems with the touch pad, mine works fine. The problem of things not responding looks like W8 problems to me. Read the problems below in Other Thoughts."
"POSITIVE", "Looks good, nice screen, thin and light"
"POSITIVE", "Good value"
"POSITIVE", "Screen clarity and brightness, sound quality, and overall speed are significantly better than my previous laptop that was in a similar price range."
"POSITIVE", "Quiet. Nice screen. 6 Gig of ram. 750GB HDD. USB3. Corei5."
"POSITIVE", "This is my first Lenovo notebook, and I am impressed! I had been looking at Thinkpads, but I am also a gamer. This model offered 3D performance superior to my desktop computer while not being huge AND at a low price! This laptop looks great. Just enough red accent without being over the top. Beautiful, bright screen that arrived without any dead or stuck pixels. Fit and finish appear to be decent as well. Pressing down around the keyboard didn't yield any noticeable soft spots, or creaks. No unevenness or rough edges when I ran my fingers around where the pieces join. Red keyboard back light doesn't seem to mess with my eyes like the white/blue of my wife's Macbook. Visual Studio runs well. And of course, so do games. I am mostly an MMO/MOBA player these days. The Secret World, WoW, Path Of Exile, LOTRO, and SW:TOR all look fantastic at 1080P and High to Ultra High settings. I have yet to test any FPS games, but I am assuming they will run without a hitch. Battery life seems on par with general purpose notebooks."
"POSITIVE", "This laptop is performing like a champ. I'm playing Metro 2033, Dota 2, and TF2 on highest settings right now and they just scream with the SLI 650M's. I don't miss the optical drive at all. The screen looks phenomenal. It's bright and incredibly sharp compared to my old laptop with its 1280x800 screen. The quick boot time on Windows 8, even with the 1TB HDD, surprises me...every...single...time! And that's compared to my other laptop with Windows 7 and an SSD. The keyboard is all-around excellent with its pleasing action and it's silent operation. Its backlit keys are very useful and they look sweet in the dark. The sound from the JBL speakers is surprisingly good and definitely has some bass to it. I like it!"
"POSITIVE", "I don't normally write reviews but because this was an unknown brand to me and I was hesitant to buy because of that I felt I should. This was an excellent purchase. The build quality is very good and I haven't ran into a problem yet. I am currently running Arch Linux on it with no issue (There was a minor issue when trying to install Arch Linux due to the track pad not detecting correctly. Easily solved by unloading the psmouse module)."
"POSITIVE", "The overall quality of this laptop is excellent! Plenty of power, ram and HDD space. 'Downgrade' to W7 and install on the ssd. Format the hdd and install all of the drivers. Very impressed with this thing so far I see another being purchased in the future!"
"POSITIVE", "-Lightweight -Easy to Use -Long Battery Life -Keyboard has a good feel to it, though it's plastic keys -Mousepad is good and easy to use."
"POSITIVE", "Update to my original review.."
"POSITIVE", "The greatest pro was the price. For what you pay you get a lot. the size, form factor, battery life are really good. I am using it every day and do like it. Unfortunately i called support due to what i thought was hardware. the service with them was very prompt and knowladgeable"
"POSITIVE", "sleek design looks good on paper"
"POSITIVE", "fast, light ultrabook, good price with great features."
"POSITIVE", "ALMOST everything an ultrabook should be -- reasonably priced, lightweight, powerful CPU, dedicated video -- but has issues."
"POSITIVE", "Works great in general as a pc i myself am installing a better psu and gpu also a few more fans due to the capability offered by 2 additional slots included. overall great ground pc if your looking for gaming"
"POSITIVE", "Great for mid range gaming. Upgrade-able."
"POSITIVE", "After shopping around for about two weeks with a 900 dollar budget, I have danced around d the idea of building, going through CyberPower, etc. Until I stumbled upon this machine. The specs are unbelievable for the price, and since I had more room to spend I invested in a new monitor and headset, and got expedited shipping. I have never had a solid gaming rig before, so for this price, I couldn't pass it up. hoping that the review that stated Guild Wars two on max graphics runs perfectly is accurate. Thank you new egg and Avatar!"
"POSITIVE", "Have to say I normally build my own rig, but decided to buy one for my girlfriend who prefers pc gaming for games like Skyrim. This pc runs EVERYTHING flawlessly. Quiet, quick and powerful. Ultra settings for WOW...tons of storage!!! Couldn't be happier with my purchase"
"POSITIVE", "I do design & build my own computers, but honestly get lazy...and this desktop is an example! If you are looking for something nice & basic out of the box, this works! Can you add on to it? - Yes Should you add on to it? - Don't really need to, honestly! Do you have a 'Sheldon Complex'...well, as I tell my friends..just get over yourself!!!!"
"POSITIVE", "It has a great graphics card a awesome hard drive.A good CD rom. A lot of system memory."
"POSITIVE", "The system works like a dream and started up within seconds of plugging in. It had a working code on the side of the machine and is very decent looking with a clear window to see your computer. It is built with the variety in mind and plenty of space for cooling. It glows a great blue in the front but to be honest I cant say enough good things about this computer. I was strapped for cash and looking for something/ anything that would give me that technological scratch I have been looking for and something I wont have to worry about for another 5-10 even 20 years from now. This computer runs GW2 on Highest settings without any issues at all and to be honest many of these reviews can do better with saying how functional this computer really is. Windows 8 is the best part aside from gaming and multi-tasking capabilities. I like being able to not have a start button and able to have most of the news and other features at my finger tips, my partner and I actually look at the weather review before going out. Given this system has a 6-core processor it is high end for its price and to be honest if it comes in stock again I am buying another for my partner, even HE is jealous and is a 45 year old closet gamer XD but aside from this.. Great System!"
"POSITIVE", "Worked Right out of the box. Very fast as well as quiet. keyboard isn't that bad really but it also isn't the best however I am still using it. So far I use it to play league and it can for sure play on very high settings without a problem. I have yet to download any other games that are more demanding but once I do ill post here. Windows 8 is not that bad either it can be annoying and a bit confusing but you get used to it, would be good if they tweak some things but what can you do. This is definitely worth the price and you get more out of it then what you pay its a very nice steal."
"POSITIVE", "Runs great has a awesome high end graphics card."
"POSITIVE", "For the money, this is a great purchase. Worked right out of the box flawlessly. If you are on a budget and need a powerful machine, this is definitely a good choice."
"POSITIVE", "For the money, this is a great purchase. Worked right out of the box flawlessly. If you are on a budget and need a powerful machine, this is definitely a good choice."
"POSITIVE", "Bought this to play World of Warcraft, Skyrim and Star Wars Old Republic on. Plays each game very fast. I went through 2 CyberpowerPC's before I gave up with them and bought this PC and I am totally satisfied. Was timid about buying a PC with Windows 8 but so far I'm not sure what the big fuss is about. I actually kind of like it. No complaints here."
"POSITIVE", "No problems here. Installation was easy. Runs every game smoothly haven't tried many so far but i'm impressed by what ive seen so far. Not loud at all im lvoing it. Great starter gaming pc."
"POSITIVE", "This computer packs a pretty nice punch for the price. I received my product within 3 days of ordering it, and it started right up with out a single problem. I can run everyone of my games at max graphics with 0 FPS lag. I play WoW, LoL, Diablo 3, SC2, Scarlet Blade, Vindictus, and EVE. This PC runs them all considerably well!"
"POSITIVE", "This computer is well worth the $600 price tag. It handles absolutely everything I throw at it on maximum settings without any noticeable lag.Skyrim, WoW, Neverwinter Online, Tera, you name it and this machine can run it. It came in a beautiful package and was very neat and clean looking. I am completely satisfied with this machine. Definitely the most bang for your buck."
"POSITIVE", "Fast, Light, Worked out of box, Timely Delivery, Plays WoW on Ultra - 40 FPS with everything jacked to the max in Orgrimmar. Lots of room for upgrades too!"
"POSITIVE", "Great Deal. Handles pretty much whatever I can Throw at it and then some. Iwas on a very tight budget, but needed a new computer for all the multi-tasking I do while playing video-games as well as streaming. All games so far are running extremely smooth. All in all Great Stuff very happy with Avatar. very happy with shipping time."
"POSITIVE", "Looks great. Fast. Quiet."
"POSITIVE", "It's a great deal for the price! So far it has played every game with max settings seamlessly."
"POSITIVE", "Essentially, I wanted a machine that could play any game I own, all gfx settings on ultra, and still run ~60 FPS. I searched Newegg and other marketplaces for an affordable, yet powerful gaming PC. Once I discovered the FX6164, I had the ordered completed within 30 minutes. The Processor is fantastic, easily overclocked to ~3.7ghz and the gfx card, although old, still packs a huge punch. With this setup, along with a bonus 8GB of RAM, I've been able to run DoTA2, CS:GO, HoN, and countless other games on max settings with 0 fps lag or gfx issues. Love the setup, great PC."
"POSITIVE", "Great computer, quick goes from completely off to desktop in about 10 seconds. Every game I've played on it has been able to run smoothly with no problems. Path of Exile, Neverwinter Beta, Bioshock Infinite all ran great."
"POSITIVE", "None"
"POSITIVE", "Price is great and Newegg's service makes it even better. Mine had 16GB of Kingston HyperX RAM. Everything worked right out of the box. Avatar took time to nicely route the cables and make the installation of components clean. Runs cool and quiet. Blue LEDs look good and aren't too bright. Case has expansion options, room for additional drives (2 external 5.25, 2 external 3.5) and internal options as well. The enclosure also provides plenty of additional support for more fans."
"POSITIVE", "This computer is exactly what you ask for. The pairing of the Gt 640, Fx-6100, and 16gb of ram makes for a beast gaming computer. I've only tested World of Warcraft and Black Ops 2 on this computer, however. WoW plays with ultra settings and absolutely no lag, and as for CoD, you can play on high with 60-70 fps. For the money, you couldn't get a better computer. I am very pleased with how fast it shipped, and the overall experience with Avatar. I had recently purchased an iBuyPower computer, and that was a nightmare. Awful shipping/customer service, and it was just an overall bad experience. But with Avatar, they make quality computers and package very nicely. 5 eggs to ya, Newegg."
"POSITIVE", "Fast machine, looks good, everything is what they said it would be."
"POSITIVE", "I only had this computer for a day. It is quiet and seems working properly. Fast&Decent graphics."
"POSITIVE", "Overall, an excellent value Getting set up was easy, and everything seems to be in working order. Compared to my two older computers (Pentium 4 and Athlon 64) this thing is a monster. Handles basic software with ease, of course. Civilization 5 on high settings runs smoothly (haven't tried any more demanding games yet). 3D render speeds (3Delight) are about 20 times faster than on the Athlon, and I haven't noticed any lag with OpenGL. Nice, well-ventilated case with space for extra fans in case you need them"
"POSITIVE", "The cardboard box it came in served it's purpose."
"POSITIVE", "Being a computer systems engineer I have a decent knowledge of good 'Bangs for the Buck' this computer def. fits that bill. Bought for a second gaming pc used mostly to play WoW. It has exceeded my expectations. The game runs at over 60fps w/the new content the non lag issues have been great!! As for the keyboard and mouse- yes they are cheap but most ppl like myself already have our favorite gaming setup anyway."
"POSITIVE", "For the price, this machine is a beast. I have Skyrim, with 60+ mods added, running at the highest possible settings without a drop in DPS. This thing could handle nearly any current PC game to an HD level. If you're on a budget, and need a powerful gaming machine, this is for you! It worked right out of the box and was set up, and most importantly didn't have all the crapware that usually comes with new computers. Also, the casing includes much room for improv and customization. The machine runs whisper-quiet, even when handling large/multiple processes. A side note, I bought this system for a dual purpose: for gaming and for music monitoring/mixing. It works perfectly for both and has amazing speed and performance."
"POSITIVE", "6 cores, 16 g ram, ok graphics card, all good for 600, good deal, played sc2,diablo 3,wow, lol, on ultra with basically to hiccups at all."
"POSITIVE", "This computer has exceeded all my expectations. Boots up in about 10 seconds, its quite, and its powerful. The product key is on top of the computer for those of you who can't find it. It plays all my games on high-ultra settings with around 50 fps and up. So far I have played WoW and Guild Wars 2 on here. Both run on max without any lag. For the price, this is a great deal. it has double the RAM than most computers in this price range and a better graphics card."
"POSITIVE", "It seems nice and runs quiet."
"POSITIVE", "all around good specs and the power supply should do fine with what comes installed. if you were to add additional cards you might consider upgrading the power but PSUs aren't that expensive"
"POSITIVE", "I don't know about this computer I think I should buy it but it has a low wattage power supply for a 6 core and a 2 GB graphics card can someone help me"
"POSITIVE", "Great power at great price point for 'average'? games? I dont know how to judge this comp cause im not playing brand new games at crazy settings. Runs Wow at max settings no prob. Windows 8 isnt as bad as everyone says"
"NEGATIVE", "The only trouble I have had so far is adjusting the power management settings so I can squeeze more life out of my battery but I have yet to check out Google's literature about it so I am sure it is me not doing it right and not the computer"
"NEGATIVE", "Not the best screen, no removable battery."
"NEGATIVE", "- Chrome OS can be limiting - Borderline build quality"
"NEGATIVE", "The A/C adapter doesn't insert all the way onto the device leaving it looking flimsy and cheap. The touchpad is also push sensitive, like a mouse button, so because the case is a little flimsy, holding it wrongly can trigger a mouse button press. That is probably the biggest annoyance. When resuming from standy it takes some time for the Wi-Fi to come back. Instead of just reconnecting to the last network, it completely rescans for available networks, before connecting. The Bluetooth only works with keyboards and mice, so don't get your hopes up if you're hoping to connect to your Android device via Bluetooth."
"NEGATIVE", "i like it its good not bad i like keyboard lol"
"NEGATIVE", "A little sluggish, though not a deal breaker Feels cheaper than my Macbook Air"
"NEGATIVE", "speakers could be better, would LOVE IT if it had a back-lit keyboard... remote desktop doesnt handle full screen anything from the remote computer. just run windowed mode, problem solved."
"NEGATIVE", "none as i knew what i was buying."
"NEGATIVE", "Chrome Logo sticker is missing."
"NEGATIVE", "None that are immediately apparent"
"NEGATIVE", "AWESOME CHROME BOOK! GREAT TO HAVE IT!"
"NEGATIVE", "I would say that the 2 year 100 gig free of Google drive is awesome, but it would be more cool if it was 4 years, and lasted the life of this machine.I can't say if google will convince me to subscribe when my 2 years are up but I would like plenty of time to have a reason to. The webcam is not as good as my cell phone cam, so it just leaves a little to be desired but that is the only flaw."
"NEGATIVE", "Not really a con but should be noted that it's not a full blown (or even half blown) laptop...so don't expect it to function in ways like your home PC/mac/or laptop running windows or iOS...but for e-mail, documents, web browsing, pic and video viewing etc it's perfect."
"NEGATIVE", "like i said, if youre getting this you should know what it comes with and what you can do. Cant really say its a con, since it shouldnt be expected. OH, the mouse clicker has a different way to 'right click' that takes some getting used to."
"NEGATIVE", "Limited apps compared to IOS or Android devices, No Java (which is becoming less relevant), Security concerns"
"NEGATIVE", "None!"
"NEGATIVE", "- Trackpad lacks a hardware right-click - Trackpad clicker doesn't seem to like working when you rest your hands on either side of it. - ChromeOS - Baffling lack of a Caps Lock key"
"NEGATIVE", "Non yet..."
"NEGATIVE", "Only one - No mkv support. Yet."
"NEGATIVE", "Not having full, Windows-like driver functionality for all-in-one printers. No Delete key."
"NEGATIVE", "I tried playing music through this device and even tried watching videos from other websites then I noticed how the audio was sluggish it was constantly skipping through the videos and music each time I played a video or music. I have seen my peers use there Samsung Chromebook and there machine works flawlessly when it comes playing videos and audio. I used to think it was a glitch and that a update would help it but its not, its not a software issue I assume its a malfunction. That's why I say be weary of buying these products. I strongly hope that Newegg can help me with this issue, but i'm weary since it has been 4 months since purchase and I already have a machine that lags the audio."
"NEGATIVE", "Occasionally the physical click on the touchpad sticks, I have read a couple of other people have the same issue but it is rare. Also if you're prone to having a whole bunch of tabs open at once, Chrome OS can chug a little bit. I guess you could see it as another way to encourage you to keep things lean and productive right?"
"NEGATIVE", "So this is by far the strangest thing I have experienced this first hand. -Wife complains 'The mouse isn't working right, fix it!' -I take Chromebook, unplug from cord as it wouldn't reach me. -I try, and reply 'Works just fine for me' Apparently the touchpad is jittery/choppy when plugged into certain outlets, something to do with interference from the AC outlet. Yes it was plugged into a surge protector at the time. Oh and Skype does not work with Chromium."
"NEGATIVE", "n/a"
"NEGATIVE", "none, for what we need."
"NEGATIVE", "Not good for Windows Applications, RAM is limited. If left unplugged for a few weeks, will lose entire charge - apparently, some trickle drainage of current is in play here."
"NEGATIVE", "Speaker needs an improvement."
"NEGATIVE", "none that I have encounter"
"NEGATIVE", "Non at all"
"NEGATIVE", "You need a good wifi connection for the Chromebook for most tasks. No ethernet port. Not many offline apps available. Besides the browser, there aren't many native apps. Not really a con for me, but I took away 1 star for the apps because it could be a problem for other people."
"NEGATIVE", "Mousepad takes getting used to. Screen could be brighter"
"NEGATIVE", "OS crashes almost every time I use it. The interface is difficult to navigate and everything is SOOO SLOOOOW. If you are thinking about getting this to stream anything online, don't waste your time. Hulu freezes constantly. I can't even play any video files from my external hard drive because they are so jumpy and freeze up. From this experience, I can only assume that it is best to wait a few more years for the bugs to be worked out of the Chrome OS. In addition, the hardware is just too slow. The whole idea for me purchasing the Chromebook was for an inexpensive option because I don't have to pay for all the Microsoft HW, but I'd much rather use my Dell with Windows 8 than use this piece of junk. I am currently begging Newegg to accept my return."
"NEGATIVE", "Very low cost notebook and it shows."
"NEGATIVE", "The mousepad is tricky at first, I can see what google was trying to do, but they could of avoided all problems but including a built in right click into the mousepad."
"NEGATIVE", "Keyboard letters are lower case and smaller than caps No VNC Viewer for ARM processors - yet No Delete key"
"NEGATIVE", "power connector could have been a USB a bit more durable"
"NEGATIVE", "My only con, which is dwarfed by the pros, is that the touchpad seems to get stuck if you press to click. However, if you touch to click, all is well."
"NEGATIVE", "Screen could be higher resolution, but I'd fear text would be tiny if that were the case, on non-scaling websites. It also auto-adjusts brightness, and as far as I know, you cannot change this. (Un)fortunately it does so rapidly; simply putting my head slightly more in the way can change it. The bottom 30% of the brightness meter is pretty much useless. Too dark for almost any normal usage scenario except dead of night. I find my sweet spot is typically just about 50%. It failed to play a Blu-ray 1080p rip at an acceptable framerate. I forget what the file type was. Local or USB and SD storage don't tell you how full they are. The local media player is more of a sound player. No playlist function or browsing by artist. Have your music organized by folders. Some weird behavior with YouTube and my plugin, YouTube Options. Still trying to get to the bottom of that."
"NEGATIVE", "-Has some type of slot on the back (I believe it is the SIM card slot on the 3G version), which I do not have). It is plugged with some rubber thing and the cover on the slot is very loose. Why not remove this altogether on the Wi-Fi only model? -Charger cable is begging to be broken off completely -Ambient light sensor is a little too sensitive -No Java support -Can be slightly sluggish when just starting up -Hinge sticks out when the notebook is closed, kind of ruins the aesthetics"
"NEGATIVE", "Within 5 days the keyboard sticks and holds down as if i was clicking it, i can't return or replace, yay."
"NEGATIVE", "The one thing I don't like is you cant keep it in your backpack because the screen presses against the keys. It cant have any weight on top of it.... that's it though"
"NEGATIVE", "No . AVI support. slightly limited when offline."
"NEGATIVE", "Has a bit of lag when scrolling on image-heavy pages such as an image search, but not enough to mar the experience. The OS could use a bit more polish still. For example, I sometimes have to log into my Google accounts in Chrome after logging in using those same credentials for the OS itself. Not a big deal but seems like it shouldn't be needed."
"NEGATIVE", "The reason for this review is to warn others of cracking screen issues. BING search for screen issues on this model."
"NEGATIVE", "The Chromebook does not work with an external display. I'm not sure why they bothered placing an HDMI port on it. Google and Samsung are apparently aware of the issue and are working to resolve it but we can't keep replacing Chromebooks while they fix it."
"NEGATIVE", "I believe this is a problem with many, but the microphone for g+ hangouts can be problematic. I'm using a workaround on the Chrome forums, will hopefully be patched soon."
"NEGATIVE", "Well lets start off with build quality... The casing creaks all the time. When I type the keyboard goes in allot and sometimes makes a creaking noise. Okay lets move on to software. All there is is chrome (I knew this when I was buying it BTW) No applications at all just shortcuts to other websites really. Any cool game (Like Bastion) will not play on this device because of the ARM CPU. (I also knew about this) Screen is meh Netflix STILL DOES NOT WORK!!! Crashes once in a while. Okay so not too long ago i had another problem... I was watching a youtube video (which usually lags in 720p btw) and all of the sudden it froze... I was like 'okay i just shut it down i guess...' nope, i couldn't turn it off! I had to wait for the battery to die for it to turn off and then charge it to work again. Not cool."
"NEGATIVE", "i5 processor only 4GB RAM Slow 512GB 5400rpm HHD Average resolution"
"NEGATIVE", "None!"
"NEGATIVE", "None so far."
"NEGATIVE", "could have given you more memory but ut dnt cost but $37 to upgrade to 8 gigs of ram"
"NEGATIVE", "switchfrom windowscouldbe alittleproblem"
"NEGATIVE", "500 dollar Windows laptops have better specs then this."
"NEGATIVE", "The computer is so sleek, it's like you don't want to touch it, my wife and I both cover it up when we finish using it!!!!!!"
"NEGATIVE", "N/A"
"NEGATIVE", "Only 2 USB Ports(Set off by bluetooth 4.0 and your set)"
"NEGATIVE", "Unfortunately, my experiences with this Vivobook S400CA laptop have soured my impression of ASUS. I purchased this laptop as a Christmas present for my mother. The laptop shipped with a faulty display cable. Whenever the laptop is moved or bumped slightly, the screen scrambles into random RGB values for each pixel, making it completely unreadable. Moreover, the cooling fans are extremely loud even after cleaning as if the DC motors themselves have bad bearings. I'm on the other side of the country; otherwise, I would just open up the laptop myself and replace the fans and re-seat the display cable. Instead, I exercised my warranty and sent in the laptop to ASUS for repair. On the phone, they asked me if they could 'refresh' the computer (nice euphemism -- less knowledgeable users would be fooled not knowing that this entailed losing their files). I knew right away this meant wiping and re-imaging the hard drive, so I explained that wiping the drive would be unnecessary for what is certainly a hardware problem. They promised me they would notify me if they needed to do this, and astutely/suspiciously, I instructed my mother to back up all of her files before sending it in. The laptop came back two weeks later with the loud fans and the display cable issues still remaining but with a wiped hard drive (they didn't even ask, as promised). I also had to ask the customer support representative for a free shipping label (instead of being reminded that I had this option). They definitely bank on (pun intended) a lot of people forgetting to ask for their free shipping label and ending up paying for shipping themselves. All in all, they merely sent back the same unit without any modifications or attempts at repairing it besides a clean re-installation of Windows 8."
"NEGATIVE", "There seems to be a definite hardware issue with this machine. It randomly reboots. Not like a proper windows reboot, but power just cuts off completely and the machine starts up again. This is absolutely terrible as there is no warning, even if the machine is plugged in or has a full battery charge. Also the touchpad scrolling usually stops working after the machine has come out of sleep. Sometimes it still works, but you can never count on it."
"NEGATIVE", "Thermal compound. Full load with the stock thermal paste I was hovering around 85c full load. I replaced with some CM Thermal Fusion 400 (what I had). This dropped the load temps 5-7degrees c."
"NEGATIVE", "Defective screen and Asus unreachable. I love this laptop for the most part, but I seem to have an issue with my screen that periodically the liquid inside settles in a blob in the center of the screen (directly opposite the Asus logo on the back). This is resolved only through pressing hard on the rear side of the screen and moving the liquid around. I've attempted to fill out a support ticket with Asus on two computers from two different browsers and can't get it to submit. Will try giving them a call next week but this is exceptionally aggravating."
"NEGATIVE", "Ergonomics - Highly reflective screen makes it hard to work in brightly lit areas. The keyboard is very difficult to work with and the touch pad is too big - takes up 1/2 of the space and it gets in the way on the stretch to the keyboard."
"NEGATIVE", "back lit keyboard would be a nice addition. I'm ok with touch typing but did not learn positioning of the Fn keys like volume up/dn etc.. 1080 IPS screen would make this laptop an exceptional one."
"NEGATIVE", "The system keeps pausing sometimes, not all the time. It looks like crash issue; so, I have had to remove the wireless adapter driver and reinstall again and again everytime the pausing issue occur. And, as others mentiond, touchscreen sometimes stops function."
"NEGATIVE", "Control pad positioning is a big drawback for this computer. the Control is suppose to be in the Middle instead of on the left side. Hard to use the control pad and not smoothy as the Dell PC."
"NEGATIVE", "I have had this computer for more then 3 month and have use less then 2 week's. The hard drive went out on day one and now it freezes every time i turn it on. Save your money and not buy this product!"
"NEGATIVE", "Wifi Card has an extremely short range. Works well when I am in the same room as the router, but after leaving the room and walking out around 15-20 feet internet gets extremely sluggish. This completely ruined my 'New Laptop' experience. I have decided to get a USB network adapter card."
"NEGATIVE", "Touch screen is flakey at best. After uninstalling some ASUS programs, the touch screen does not work at all. Speaking of the ASUS programs, many of their settings pages are there only for show, and do not actually change the behavior of input devices. Biggest con of all is Windows 8. I really wanted to like it, but it is just clunky and not at all user friendly. Does not work well with this device"
"NEGATIVE", "Like i said, not all laptops can have it all, and especially not cheap in price. These aren't necessary all Cons but what some or i at least desire to have. I didn't go for sony because they are expensive and feel cheap, sad. Lenovo yoga very nice but read review were lcd break easily. Acer M5, almost went for it, but the vivobook finish is was much better, almost like a macbook air. Toshiba, well i am a Toshiba tech and i got tire of them but if it wasn't vivobook it was Toshiba ultrabook u945 series. -No optical drive (i dont care, some will) -No backlit Keyboard (why i don’t know, sigh it’s all it needed IMO) -No Bluetooth -LCD is a little faint in color (You can fix this with Saturation or color Enhancement) -4.4 pounds, not the lightest still really good ( pro or con, depends on person) -Headphone Jack and Mic in the same port (Hmmmm)"

"NEGATIVE", "I hate this laptop. I can't seem to use it efficiently. I thought it was just beginner's issues but I've now had it for three months and I just hate it more and more. I can't get certain things to work, the scroll doesn't work well, I can't get windows to close, if you touch the mouse pad just the right way you can delete everything you just typed...the keys are horrible...I just hate it. I wish I could return it and go back to my 10 year old Dell. For an average tech person who just wants to do papers, business things, and have a computer to work the right way, this thing is horrible."
"NEGATIVE", "nothing"
"NEGATIVE", "The lack of bluetooth is something that I honestly overlooked because at this point I felt that it would be standard.. I didn't think anything considered an 'ultrabook' would come standard without such a basic feature.. The RJ45 jack on the right hand side of the unit flips open, which I have seen before.. Unfortunately I have seen a few broken at the hinge as well. This one feel sturdy but it's always a weakness when I rely on the connection frequently. The Mic and Headphone port are the same physical port, the functionality is just switched with an Asus tool. This is unfortunate when you need input along with headphones. Again this shows the lack of bluetooth to be an issue as a paired headset would resolve this as well."
"NEGATIVE", "wireless network had to be updated due to random drops, no big deal. went to ASUS downloads and updated Atheros Wireless Lan Driver and Application from its web site. Also had to go into the wireless network in control panel and go into power management and disable the power saver feature - which caused it to drop the router once the power got low inorder to conserve energy."
"NEGATIVE", "Touch screen stop working after 2 weeks and upgraded to win 8 pro."
"NEGATIVE", "Windows 8. It's not what we're used to but I'm sure we'll all get the hang of it. I'm more tech-savvy than my wife so I prefer Windows XP style where I can configure everything myself instead of tiles but I'm sure my wife will get used to it."
"NEGATIVE", "The only problem I have with this notebook is with the screen. I have one little dead pixel I noticed. It's in a hard-to-notice area, so I'm not completely frustrated with this."
"NEGATIVE", "If I had to really bang my head over anything I'd have to go with; no Bluetooth. That is something I would have expected ASUS to throw in as a given. With today's level of technology and ASUS's bulk access to these devices at a significantly reduced price, how could they not? Too much Bloatware. Easily removed, though."
"NEGATIVE", "The power save software (Powergear I believe?) is a double layer to the built in windows power save function. It will often supersede windows settings, forcing the CPU levels down even while plugged in. (adjustments to this seem to have no effect, minimalist is really the only setting it likes.) Un-install that software and you are golden. The touch-pad takes a bit of getting used too. You will find yourself swapping screens a lot during normal motions. Again, this is a touchscreen so your not on that touch-pad often, but slightly annoying when you are. Those times you are on it are usually due to small icons (fat fingers) or finiky browser plugins. Not a direct product fault at all."
"NEGATIVE", "If you don't want a good display then I suppose it's fine. But I'm very picky when it comes to the display I look at all day. For $700 it has a display on it which is worse than the 11.2 inch model for some reason. Screen Quality Was Hideous. Text Was Difficult To Read. Rather Heavy For An UltraBook. I Returned It. Seems odd to have a corei5 laptop with such a bad display. Btw, I did try both enlarging the text as well as using different clear type settings to no avail. The color contrast changed drastically when moving the display back and forth. It supposedly has an LED panel, which made me think it'd be at least better than most. I was wrong, hey it happens. I'm going to wait and save up for a Lenovo Yoga 13.3 or the Asus Ultrabook UX31A-BHI5T11. They're simply the best screens I've seen at BBuy and are corei5's with SSD. Oh and they're Windows 8 touchscreens which I do love."
"NEGATIVE", "Screen resloution is not as high as VIZIO Run 720HD but not 1080HD on Youtube with 4 ram camera is blurred. 3 cell battery Max Ram 8G"
"NEGATIVE", "There's a fair amount of 'bloatware' from ASUS preloaded. It's easy to get rid of, but still annoying."
"NEGATIVE", "No backlit keyboard"
"NEGATIVE", "I wish the Keyboard keys had a little more travel when pressing"
"NEGATIVE", "not 1080 screen, only 768 lines not ISP, only TN not a discrete video card"
"NEGATIVE", "Can't think of any serious ones. If were to nitpick I'd say that the magsafe adapter pops out a little too easily sometimes."
"NEGATIVE", "...things started breaking. Now I baby my electronics, I don't throw them in a bag or toss them on the table or whatever that causes wear on other people's laptops. I had no dents, no scratches on this laptop, I even had a screen protector on it and a keyboard cover. One complaint, the laptop always ran a bit warm. In fact, on occasion it would get very hot and I could hear the fan spool up and make noise. Come to find out, it's because I watch YouTube videos a lot as well as go to other flash websites and OSX is very inefficient at playing back flash - uses a lot more resources than it should. After about 3 months, it started getting so hot the laptop would shut off. I took it in to the Apple store and they had it for about a week, a defective heatsink they told me. I don't see how that's possible, a heatsink can't really be defective...maybe the fan, but I heard it spinning still and I already cleaned it out to make sure dust wasn't clogging it up. So that fixed I was good for about another month, then the thunderbolt port just stopped working. Back to the Apple store, this time they told me the logic board was bad and replaced it. Was really getting worried at this point because I didn't buy Apple care, but so far all under warranty repairs. I was using it up until last month, and now the trackpad has decided to stop working. I've been using it with a mouse and that's fine, but I need to take it back to the Apple store to fix the trackpad now."
"NEGATIVE", "Pricey for a lower end machine, they could have included 8gig rams instead of 4... Maybe make a 13 with discrete graphics and Quad core? As I said above I LOVE this form factor and design but the performance improvements in the 15 are huge!"
"NEGATIVE", "It's a bit pricey. Some will say you can get a similar laptop for a lot less money. I don't think so (see below), but, if all you need is the same CPU, RAM and Graphics card, and don't need all of the features that make this unique, then you can spend a lot less money on a windows laptop. The aluminum enclosure is gorgeous, dissipates heat and thus stays cool, but may be very scratch prone. However, because it's such a popular laptop, there are lots of protective options. The screen is bright, glossy, and beautiful. However, it's smudge city. It's difficult to keep clean, and attracts fingerprints. Mini DisplayPort is the only video output option, which requires an adapter or dongle of some sort in order to handle most displays. Though there are miniDP to HDMI dongles, there is no HDMI port on this machine. It isn't also a spaceship."
"NEGATIVE", "Not gamer friendly and no where near enough options available."
"NEGATIVE", "It doesn't have a file management system like there would be on a computer running Windows, OS X, or Linux. The only way to do things on it is through Google drive, which necessitous the use of another computer to put some files onto the Google drive account to begin with. Although it can be very nifty, and convenient, having no file management is quite limiting."
"NEGATIVE", "Manual has no directions on how to use the touchpad. Had to Google search. I knew it didn't just have a left click and no scrolling ability. Go here for some quick tips for new users. http://support.google.com/chromeos/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=1047367"
"NEGATIVE", "Screen is a little on the small side, but it doesn't affect anything, esp. since this little guy is always on my lap, and not far away when used!"
"NEGATIVE", "It is No mac book air, but very similar....plus about 800$ cheaper. You cant put a CD in (but i dont care) No Netflix :( Speakers are on bottom so if on your lap you need to aim the front up a little to not block speaker. No internet. Nothing to do, except maybe notes for class."
"NEGATIVE", "None"
"NEGATIVE", "Sure, it's a Chromebook. Heaven help you when you need a repair or replacement part . . . then you'll understand how much this thing REALLY costs. Do not put this in the hands of anyone under the age of 21, and even then . . ."
"NEGATIVE", "The only browser you can use is Chrome so don't even think about using Firefox. If you're looking for something with all the functional capabilities of a laptop then this is not for you. However, for basic everyday use this device is perfect."
"NEGATIVE", "Offline use is improving, but still less than a 'real' laptop SD card sticks out of side slot Screen is picky about viewing angles"
"NEGATIVE", "I keep hitting the Search button on the keyboard when I wanna use all caps (there is no Caps Lock button)"
"NEGATIVE", "have had it over 5 weeks and cannot send it back but cannot play games due to display driver malfunction. No one at New Egg really offered to help and told me to contact Lenovo about it. Not happy with NEW EGG. I have spent $100 to get this fixed but still not fixed."
"NEGATIVE", "None outside of what was listed in my previous review."
"NEGATIVE", "hardware failure first month, dell sent a pickup tag, and repaired it. but then software (OS?) failed and machine won't restart. dell sent out a recovery DVD. what's the problem with that? the machine does not have a dvd drive, uses usb flash drive. supposedly dell is sending out a usb flash drive."
"NEGATIVE", "Honestly for the price you are paying, you are getting a great deal. The processor isn't the fastest, but its no slug. wish it had a i5 Its a new laptop, so ACER still probably has to work on some of their drivers because of users reported of freezing issues. I already fixed the issue, by updating some of the drivers, so not really a big deal. it was 529.99 when I bought it :(, now its 449.99!!! even more of a steal. Windows 8 takes some getting used to, but heard they releasing a new update soon, and will make it better for people who don't have touch screens."
"NEGATIVE", "Cons: -I had it fixed on the day I got it cause something did not sound right when it is on. -5400rpm HDD"
"NEGATIVE", "I have to say is how large and heavy the actual laptop is, but its expected since its a 17 inch powerhouse. The speakers are a bit on the low side. the amplified headphone jack is really loud when using a headset. webcam isn't HD quality, its 0.9mp as most if not all others are 2.0mp already."
"NEGATIVE", "Horrible ram defect. It games with what it had said(12gb) the day of setup gave me memory errors and eventually kept from rebooting windows all together. Luckily I have PC experience and quickly noticed that they have Samsung memory in the laptop. I took a stick out and worked instantly. If you buy this product I recommend swapping brand name memory. Samsung makes horrible products. So I have 16gbs of memory heading my way (g.skill) The hard drive as well is only a 5400rpm. Works well but still not up to par like everything else that is on the laptop. Will be ordering an ssd drive soon."
"NEGATIVE", "speakers arent great but i have yet to see a laptop with super amazing speakers so no biggie"
"NEGATIVE", "Couldnt get it to turn on right out of the box. Same thing, the keyboard lights up and the dvd player will start up and thats it. If I push the on and off power button about 20-30 times it will eventually turn on but as soon as I turn it off, restart, or it goes to 'sleep' it wont turn back on again. The times I did get it to turn on the positioning of the mouse pad is very annoying because you constantly hit it with your palm and it does random things you dont want it too."
"NEGATIVE", "*Large/Bulky *Battery life not great (this was expected) *5400 RPM drive really lets it down. *Windows 8"
"NEGATIVE", "Cannot use other browsers, few addons & themes. The weak part of this machine is, the tip of the adapter/charger. Withing days my daughter broke it by accident and now I am having a very hard time finding a replacement. Samsung referred me to a company that charges 86 dollars for a new one."
"NEGATIVE", "This is a Chromebook so arguing that it is not a traditional OS that you can install apps on is a specious argument, so it is absurd to say that is a con for this device. The only thing I could come up with is that maybe the screen could be a little better (not in terms of resolution, more just the lighting and viewing angles)."
"NEGATIVE", "Where do you begin? There are those who will tell you 'I knew what I was getting into when I ordered this Chromebook...' that is just code for 'I'm an idiot and I was so cheap that I wasn't willing to spend an extra $150 to purchase a real laptop.' (I was going to give it to my Mom for Christmas, but decided her old Pentium 4 Sony Vaio was better so I upgraded the RAM and bought a new battery for it and sold the Chromebook). The screen viewing angle is basically 3mm. You have to pinpoint the angle or else you are viewing black screen or looking at a mirror image of yourself. I KNEW THIS, but the memory can't be upgraded, nor can the hard disk. What I didn't know is that the desktop wasn't used for anything. Everything is done through Chrome. The Arm dual core A15 CPu is the most overrated piece of trash ever produced. The quad core version is used in a $300 cell phone, but Google was so cheap, they settled for the dual core. The Mali GPU (yeah I researched it for a few DAYS before ordering) is so overrated as well. I could barely play a Facebook slot game without extreme stuttering. Flash games are terrible on it. Streaming video is also choppy and worse than my 11 year old Pentium 4's iGPU. In fact, the overall performance of this device is comparable to an early Pentium 4 or late Pentium 3."
"NEGATIVE", "Because it is a netbook it cant do certain things. Do your research and think about exactly what you are going to be using your laptop for. 1 or 2 more USB ports would have been nice but I think that might be asking for a lot at this price point."
"NEGATIVE", "The only complaints I have are that I am still waiting for Netflix and Skype to work, but I know they are working on it. Some people are reporting issues with BT pairing but again, they are working on it. Look how long Apple took to fix the maps app after they released the new iPhone 5. They knew the app was faulty but they released it anyway."
"NEGATIVE", "Limited viewing angle. Small 16 GB hard drive. The desktop is not used. Limited offline use. Cannot upgrade RAM or hard disk. Auto dims screen."
"NEGATIVE", "Dead on Arrival - when arrived, screen showed 'Chome OS missing or damaged, please create recovery drive'. So I created the recovery using my imac, tried to reinstall Chrome OS on the Chromebook and it failed the first time, then succeeded (not really) the second time. When trying to log in, machine froze and reset to the 'Chrome OS Missing or Damaged' screen. Have yet to get the Chromebook to operate. Because it is such a hot item, Newegg does not have a replacement and won't put me on a waiting list, so I'm stuck just refreshing the page all the time hoping to score a working model. Very Frustrating."
"NEGATIVE", "Screen view angle is poor. The whole thing creaks a little. But the main problem is with the Chromebook concept itself. The Google ecosystem (gmail, docs, youtube, play, maps, etc.) works well, but almost nothing else is available (other than by major hackery involving Linux). No netflix (at least at this time), no silverlight, no java, no VPN access that is worth much. The app set available is very unimpressive. Google play media content is also unimpressive. Perhaps these will grow better with time, and the chromebook will become more useful. As a simple computer for someone with modest google-only goals, it is OK. But maybe not for the grandparents because it is too small for easy reading. Performance of the ARM cortex-a15 appears similar to that of a very low-end x86."
"NEGATIVE", "Netflix doesn't work as of yet. Charger is very bulky. When put through some normal test such as running video on one tab and another website on another tab. The video was very choppy. These are not really Cons. It is a great machine for the cost. It does what it is intended to do."
"NEGATIVE", "Hinge. It is ugly but I would rather sacrifice looks then range of motion. The display is limited which is expected the low cost system if it could open 15-25 degrees more it would be a bonus."
"NEGATIVE", "This laptop could have been great if only for the display. I didn't have high expectations, but the vertical viewing angles are terrible and colors appear washed out. I was lucky to get one of the free Chromebooks, the CR-48, and in a side-by-side comparison of the displays, it exceeds the Samsung in viewing angles, contrast and overall brightness. I wasn't expecting a IPS display, but I was hoping that it would at least match a product that was given out for free. The display reminds of me of my first IBM Thinkpad from 1995. I prefer matte screens over glossy ones, but this particular matte screen is one of the worst I've seen."
"NEGATIVE", "Pain in the buttocks to actually find one in stock!"
"NEGATIVE", "They are hard to find, need more accessories"
"NEGATIVE", "small hard drive, but its good enough for what i bought this thing for."
"NEGATIVE", "I love the idea of chrome OS, but this laptop still has some issues. Not being able to watch netflix out of the box is almost a deal breaker for me. I know a fix is coming, but lets face it, they should have had this figured out before releasing it. The trackpad sounds cheap and its loud. When I click on the trackpad I cringe at the sound it makes. I know you can just tap it, but unfortunately chrome OS doesn't let you set the sensitivity settings for the track pad and my taps are just too light. Within the first few days of owning it the top of the lid started to get scuff marks on it, which is frustrating because it takes away that 'shiny-new-toy' feeling you get from owning a new gadget and seriously detracts from the form factor. Its not like this thing was abused, but I had it next to a book and some papers in my messenger bag and the paint appears to be rubbing off just from being in contact with other flat objects. And one final thing, sometimes I would manually have to reconnect the wifi every time I woke the device form sleep on certain networks, although this wasn't an issue with my home network."
"NEGATIVE", "The track pad is decent, maybe im just not used to it yet. Works fine, just not as responsive with the scrolling as i thought, sure i will get used to it by tomorrow. Also the back of the laptop isnt very impressive, just a Google logo and Samsung text. I personally could care less about appearance so it doesn't bother me."
"NEGATIVE", "It won't make me coffee. It doesn't run Mac OS (yet). Everything has to be done on the web. It's crashed on me once or twice. It doesn't alway display youtube videos correctly."
"NEGATIVE", "The touchpad is a bit wonky. Call me old-fashioned but I like buttons."
"NEGATIVE", "Track pad is just a little too small. Support for some games (Bastion) and Netflix is a bummer but is said to be fixed. A little bit of lag issues on some things but mostly just flash stuff."
"NEGATIVE", "Under powered: eMMC drive performance, Xorg graphic drivers need optimized. I believe this new CPU and GPU are much more capable. The primary problem is that this system isn't mature and should only get better with time."
"NEGATIVE", "Chrome OS stinks. Out of the box apps work but I feel extremely limited to what I can do. Everything is web based but many of the things I like to do are not available on the chrome book. no Skype, no netflix, no vpn client, etc ,etc.."
"NEGATIVE", "see question above"
"NEGATIVE", "Viewing angles on the display suck. Contrast is terrible. Build quality is cheap -- mine is missing glue at several places along the seam of the plastic case. Overall, the device feels a bit like a toy. It is definitely portable but may not be durable."
"NEGATIVE", "Cheap feel"
"NEGATIVE", "too novel. This requires a mind set that's not shared by many."
"NEGATIVE", "I expect people will come up with unfair things (running windows apps, playing playstation games, etc), but they are intellectually dishonest to do so. That's like being upset your skateboard doesn't have a trunk to carry groceries home."
"NEGATIVE", "cheap build quality, giant hinge on the back. The giant unsightly hinge is (IMO) a direct result of the cheap build, which was a direct result of the price point. It's not so bad that I feel nervous that it's gonna be a problem as the thing begins to age, but it's not going to impress anyone based on looks. I brought it into work and my co-workers were less than thrilled...until they heard the price. Netflix still doesn't work but the word is that they're working on it. Also...when we were testing the Google Hangouts on our new Chromebooks, we weren't able to use the enhanced features like adding hats and crowns to your face because we weren't able to install the plugin on this thing. Small issue, but an issue."
"NEGATIVE", "SD Card sticks out a bit, doesnt fit in flush"
"NEGATIVE", "Flash ads can cause stuttering to 'Oh snap/he's dead jim' problems. About half speed of 550. Minimal network configuration options, but at least can connect to a VPN."
"NEGATIVE", "none"
"NEGATIVE", "There was a bit of substance leaking out from LCD screen. A little cleanup was required, no other mess. I would also agree with the other reviews in regards to quality of touch pad. It is a bit more flimsy at the left and right click button areas then you would expect. But seeing as I will be using it for more of last resort and using a bluetooth mouse I bought on sale. It is not a huge hassle."
"NEGATIVE", "No keyboard backlighting No touchscreen interface Slight learning curve (navigation)"
"NEGATIVE", "Webcam/ camera not found. I was able to see the camera working for about 30 seconds after doing a 'powerwash' and restarting. I thought this fixed my problem, but once again I see camera not found when ever I attempt to launch a camera app."
"NEGATIVE", "Only one so far •Can't open certain types of files. It's mostly pros for this product except that it doesn't open certain types of files. This is only annoying for games I wanted to download but I knew that it wouldn't open these files going in."
"NEGATIVE", "the power chord broke on be in the first 6 months of ownership. The power box has shorted out, it stopped working and when i tried to plug it into a different outlet it shocked me. I cannot for the life of me find a replacement, all of the accessories are for the series 5 and everything ive read says the chargers are different sizes and not compatable."
"NEGATIVE", "Does not yet play Net flix! (This can be done using Chrome Remote Desktop with an MS Windows computer running Net flix."
"NEGATIVE", "NONE So far!"
"NEGATIVE", "Screen viewing angle isn't great, need to position it spot on, otherwise it looks dark. Charging adapter connector is very small, seems to be begging to be snapped off. The connector ideally would be on the side. When an SD card is inserted, it half hangs out so you really can't leave one in there."
"NEGATIVE", "Laptop scratches VERY EASY! The first day I received it, I had no clue how easy it was to scratch. I had my external drive next to it, when I picked it up it scrapped the side of the laptop a bit SMH! After that I have been very careful with it. If you travel alot I suggest you buy a case or sleeve for it. Itunes does NOT work. So you can't sync your ipod! That sucks since I used itunes for all music related activities. But if you use this as a second laptop (like me) then there is no problem. Just sync your ipod with your windows/mac and that wont really be a big deal. Another pro/con kindof, is that after the 2 years you can keep what you already used BUT you can't add more unless you purchase. If you delete anything you can't replace. Something I've noticed while playing Angry birds is that the trackpad is not very responsive at times. Maybe its the game but I'm not really sure. Syncing all your files to google drive is a pain in the A@#! It takes veryyy longgg! specially if you have a large collection of music! I stored all my pictures on google drive but have yet to uploaded all my music. Instead, I decided to add my music to google play, for some reason upload time was faster."
"NEGATIVE", "ONE HUGE ONE -- No recovery media included and no way to create it. This is beyond unacceptable. I understand the manufacturers not wanting to include CDs/DVDs in deference to the environment, shipping costs or whatever, but to an end user, it is unacceptable that I have no mechanism to allow me to backup and reload my computer in the event of drive failure, corruption, need to load an alternate OS, etc. Apparently, this is the case with ALL ASUS computers currently shipping with Windows 8. In my case, I had no choice but to completely wipe the hard drive and reload it with Windows 7 Pro due to major compatibility issues with some of the software I use on a daily basis. NOTE: If you have any applications which require the standalone Adobe Flash installation, forget running them on ANY Windows 8 box. This includes EVERY version of QuickBooks currently supported by Intuit. It's also funny how there's a giant ASUS logo right at the base of my screen and many of the drivers and utilities downloaded directly from the ASUS support website refused to install, saying they could only be loaded on an ASUS Laptop. Incredible... just incredible."
"NEGATIVE", "I was a bit disappointed with the processor and the regular graphics score. My Pentium 3.0 QX6850 from 2008 got better score(7.3). To replace the memory and hard drive you need a Mini Torx Screwdriver T5. There are 12 screws to remove. The memory is easier to replace. To replace the hard drive you will need to move the battery and one of the internal speakers (watch out the tiny cable). The HD UVC Webcam isn’t very good. While playing games with demanding graphics the video card fan will kick in and it gets a bit noisy (no big deal, but might bother some people). The battery does not last very long."
"NEGATIVE", "Doesn't make me toast? The 500GB 5400 RPM platter... The drive is not a hybrid drive as there is a 32GB SSD separate. Asus has the main driver partitioned as well. I can't complain too much as there have been no problems yet and it seems fairly quick. I will probably yank the HD and throw in an SSD at some point."
"NEGATIVE", "+ Text is pretty tiny. But this is a 1920x1080 13' screen, what do you expect? Because an ultra-book like this strives to squeeze max life from a charge, it's not as fast as as desktop i5 would be. But that's to be expected. + The included USB to Ethernet dongle is only 100Mbit -- pathetic. For around $40 here on NewEgg, you can buy a gigabit adapter that's also a USB3 hub. Search for 'USB303HE'. I use it instead of the included dongle. + There's no included mini-HDMI adapter, but there is a mini-VGA adapter."
"NEGATIVE", "The keyboard is unwieldy for an experienced touch typist like me. Without the shaping that keys have had since about 1960 (ya think maybe they knew something about keyboard design?) there are minimal tactile cues to orient your fingers by feel. This results in lots of errors and mysterious unwanted jumps around the screen as keys like Page Up get nicked and send the cursor flying while in the middle of a sentence. The plain, flat, rectangular keys so ubiquitous today are NOT a step forward in computer design. This shortcoming is the reason for not rating this fine, little machine with 4 or 5 eggs."
"NEGATIVE", "My only complaint would be that the touchpad is offset from the keyboard. If you happen to rest your right-hand's thumb on the surface while typing (I don't, myself), you could accidentally trigger the touchpad (unless palm detection kicks in). I'm not going to mark it down just yet because I don't have that issue. I just recognize it could be one."
"NEGATIVE", "The only thing I don't like is how easily you can see finger prints on the computer. It is very noticeable under the right light. Other than that, none at all."
"NEGATIVE", "The track pad sucks. Get a mobile mouse and keep it with you. The nature of the case/plastics attracts finger prints/oil very easily. Proprietary hardware means installing Windows 7 will make certain things not work. Googling this problem has brought about some solutions, but I'm not desperate enough to try. Don't bother using this outside. Not good against glare. I was sitting in class today and the windows behind me were open. Had to position myself to see certain parts of the screen. Not sure if this is necessarily a con, but it does NOT come with an optical drive. So if you're going to install anything, it's going to have to be either: 1) digital, 2) from a flash drive, or installed after purchasing and putting in an optical drive / external DVD-ROM. Pretty large. But that's what you get with a gaming laptop I suppose."
"NEGATIVE", "Charging cord is 1.5 mm pretty small and i am worried that i will break it. I do have varying issues with bluetooth. at times it does not work. Out of the box the intel ready boost SSD cache was not set up and sleep mode with Rapid start just didn't work. Once i enabled the cache and disabled the Rapid start the system was faster and more reliable."
"NEGATIVE", "The touchpad isn't the greatest.. It does some weird things in Windows 8 when brushed the wrong way. It's not very responsive at times as well. That's really about the only con I have for this to be honest. The unknown brand has me a little uneasy regarding warranty claims and if something ever goes wrong with this machine after it's out of warranty, if it will even be possible to buy replacement parts for this unit. (keyboard keys, battery, ect...)"
"NEGATIVE", "*Purchased one open box, battery was defective. Charged, but would not run on battery. *Avatar is a rather small unknown distributor in CA. Called the first day for an RMA, got V-mail. Next day called and got a live person, but RMA never arrived in my e-mail. In the end, returned it N.E. *Camera is sub par and grainy"
"NEGATIVE", "Track pad leaves a little to be desired. Also kinda silly but if you're going to emulate mac the one thing id copy is the magnetic power plug. Just saying."
"NEGATIVE", "Slightly noisy HD tick sound as the heads move around. Power supply 1.5 mm plug WILL get broken off at some point. Accidental swipe gestures on touchpad activate all kinds of Crazy Win8 screens."
"NEGATIVE", "Screen - Light bleed. This one isn't a huge deal as most of the time you will not be able to see it but if you are ever on a black screen, say hello to the light bleed. First time booting it up, I saw it immediately and it was pretty disappointing but during normal use for many hours you really don't notice. Not a huge deal, just something to point out. So why 4 eggs you may ask, well this is why: Battery Life - Oh for goodness sake, I don't know if I did something wrong to it or it's supposed to be this way but I only get 2.5 hours of use from this guy. I know that this laptop would not last as long as its brothers because of the GPU inside it but only 2.5 hours? The previous UX32VD (according to several reviews) gets at least 4+ hours of battery life with brightness up and wifi on. I get 2.5 hours throttling down the CPU to 50%, which you can do using another Asus software, turning the brightness all the way down and turning off wifi and bluetooth. This was a huge bummer for me and it is just incredibly disappointing. -1 Eggs for that, just horrible battery life."
"NEGATIVE", "The Achille's heel of this otherwise fine product is the touchpad/trackpad. Simple problem: the very bottom of it, when clicked down, doesn't left-click at all -- it does nothing. You have to move up a bit on the pad and then click for a proper left-click. Huge manufacturing flaw."
"NEGATIVE", "Touchpad possibly worst I've ever used. Very unresponsive and all over the place. The only downfall of this otherwise perfect notebook."
"NEGATIVE", "Windows 8 ASUS partitioned drives for backs-ups. Just not necessary. The power plug is a little big and sticks out"
"NEGATIVE", "No removable battery for when Windows does something stupid."
"NEGATIVE", "The charger plug is right angled and kind of bulky, I can see how this can cause some stress on the charge port and cause problems down the road. Not many ports."
"NEGATIVE", "windows 8 but thats an easy fix compared to anything else that could go wrong"
"NEGATIVE", "TOUCHPAD. This thing drives me a little crazy. It feels flimsy and has some odd gestures that you can apparently turn off. Thankfully I'm going to be using a mouse to game and not this so I'm not going to worry about it. For minor web browsing it's bearable. Battery life. I don't think I'm going to be gaming or browsing for 3 hours straight without being near a socket at some point in time. This thing is probably going to sit in my hotel room hooked up to a charger for 80-90% of the time. Still on the low end. Outter shell feels a tad cheap. The screen/top is very thin and bends/gives easily. Kind of scares me at times. As these two features won't be much of an impact to me I didn't deduct any stars as this machine is great."
"NEGATIVE", "None yet."
"NEGATIVE", "Noticeable high pitch whine of harddrive and fan on occasion -- ebbs in and out in random intervals Unknown company with virtually no discernible digital footprint on the web, makes it impossible to fix issues in the long run through official support/forum/channels. Windows 8 Single Language Edition (google/wiki if unsure what makes it different than regular edition)"
"NEGATIVE", "High pitch whine of fan on occasion, although it does not persist through gaming or other random programs, the high in pitch but low in volume whine of the Harddrive + fan is noticeable (but not dealbreaking). Comes with a low production value manual and a mystery disk for an ultrabook without an optical disk drive stock. Avatar is a dark horse company with almost no footprint or review on the web. Rumored to be a Samsung subsidiary but with the included Win8 single language edition, it might be more of a Chinese company (wiki win8 edition and search for the single language ed), although it's all just unsubstantiated info."
"NEGATIVE", "THIS COMPUTER DID NOT COME WITH A WINDOWS ACTIVATION KEY!!! DOES NOT COME WITH GENUINE WINDOWS!!!"
"NEGATIVE", "A little loud, the fan seems to be going constantly, the hard drive is always going, and there is this high pitch electric whine. I think its coming from the hdd No back lit keyboard, although the keyboard is great to type on. Like another reviewer said there is something strange about how it boots from sleep, sometimes it takes pushing power more than once but it after 2 or 3 times it works."
"NEGATIVE", "The only con for me was not being able to choose the OS. I'm not a big fan of Windows 7, but Windows 8 is infinitely worse. It's not even Windows anymore; it's just a caricature of iOS and Android. I had to waste several hours wiping out Windows 8 and installing Windows 7 (with over 100 security updates!), along with all the necessary drivers from the Asus website."
"NEGATIVE", "W8. Wish I had the option to do W7. I think everyone is going to work around W8 with Classic Shell or some other App. The Price of course. Crashed once. Started installing WinLiveMail and crashed with Aswnet.sys - Must be Avast problem? No Office Starter. No Ai - Recovery program. How do I make my Recovery software????"
"NEGATIVE", "the cons are other people's reviews and ignorance."
"NEGATIVE", "The keyboard is horrible. Drops about 1% of my key-presses randomly. It feels like a design issue with the tactile touch of the keys. The touchpad is horrible. By far the worst touchpad I have ever used. You can click mechanically or tap (one-finger or two-finger) for left/right clicks, and about 20% of my clicks are ignored. Even mechanically, I can hear the click and nothing happens. I have to click everything like 3 times. Even using the soft-tap clicks, frequently do nothing."
"NEGATIVE", "Everything else"
"NEGATIVE", "read below"
"NEGATIVE", "DISPLAY: Glossy. I strongly dislike these because in industrial/commercial lighting (ie overhead flourescents) conditions they reflect the bulbs back in your face...but aside from the reflectivity issue, it's great. I could do with a little bit more brightness. The bezel is really thick (especially for such a small chassis) - it makes the panel feel more cramped than it is. KEYBOARD: The biggest issue is the placement of the arrow keys with respect to the numeric keypad. For someone who is used to doing a lot of work on a 10-key or a numeric keypad, having to deal with the 'half zero key' is a big hassle. I'm sure I'll get used to it, but initial reaction is 'really?' It seems unnecessary to cram them together like that. WEIGHT: It's pretty darn heavy. I cooked up the clever idea of pulling the second 650M MXM module from the laptop to make it lighter...don't count on this. It weighs maybe 6 ounces - so the laptop will get lighter but it won't be the big change I was hoping for. SHIPPING: In what has to be the most surprising thing I've ever seen, the internal *laptop* box had several PUNCTURES a few inches in diameter. The box was still sealed, so I was honestly amazed that newegg would ship a container that had so obviously been abused - and the outer container had no marks on it whatsoever! That means that it was either punctured at Newegg's facility during packaging or before. The internal packaging wasn't bullet proof either (There are two simple end supports that hold the laptop in the box) so I (and Newegg) got really lucky that the laptop wasn't damaged by the punctures. This was a real disappointment (that Newegg would ship such an obviously damaged container). The box still had the Lenovo factory seal on it as well so... Shame on you, Newegg. EXTERIOR: Even though the top is textured, it still picks up fingerprints like a drunken sailor (is that a thing?). The all-plastic bottom definitely flexes noticeably to user touch. TRACKPAD: I'm not sure if this was a design feature, but the touchpad (as I noted about, I don't use trackpads I use mice, I'm just waiting on a BT mouse) flexes noticeably when 'clicked.' There's also not defined 'buttons' for mouse clicks (just areas - which is what makes me think that it is a design feature) - but this is slightly unnerving given the flimsy plastic enclosure. The plastic base definitely makes everyone feel cheaper than it probably should. HDD: I would've strongly preferred a 120GB SSD to a 1TB HDD. I don't know what the costs end up being, but the 5400 RPM drive definitely holds you back. Aside from the RAM (Windows will happily make use of as much RAM as you can throw at it - and you should throw as much of it as you can) this is the biggest upgrade spot."
"NEGATIVE", "AVATAR logos. Just kidding AVATAR."
"NEGATIVE", "- Slightly tight viewing angle typical with other laptops"
"NEGATIVE", "Definitely an unknown brand name. Don't let that fool you, its a quality device. Windows 8 takes some getting used to. Had to turn off edge swiping to keep the charms from opening every time I went to type on the keyboard."
"NEGATIVE", "So this computer doesn't like to reboot from Stand By mode. Don't ask me why. It just continuously turns on and off every 2 seconds when I try to turn it back on. I have to hard reboot it every time. It's a huge drag. I may go ahead and format it and install install windows 7 like advised in a previous feedback, but at the moment don't waste your money. Avatar sucks and I hope this review puts them out of business."
"NEGATIVE", "The only problem is that the cover has some spots that must have come from the company. They look like fingerprint smudges but never go away. They seem to be dents. Windows 8 is very difficult to get used to. The mic/headphone jack is a little different because you only put the cord halfway in to use the headphones, and I'm assuming you would put the mic cord in all of the way. The trackpad is a little difficult for me since my previous computer was a Toshiba but I think it works pretty efficiently as well."
"NEGATIVE", "Spent about an hour and a half trying to resolve a code 43 error in the device manager for the display adapter. Reinstalled multiple drivers multiple times, opened the PC up and made sure the card was mounted correctly. Turns out it's just a bad card. Luckily I have a GT 620 laying around, popped it in and the machine now works flawlessly. A slight downgrade, but an excuse to upgrade, so I suppose it works out in the end."
"NEGATIVE", "Windows 8 is weird. Lightweight as a whole may make it easy to move unintentionally."
"NEGATIVE", "I've had to restart a couple times but I'm pretty sure thats my fault"
"NEGATIVE", "NONE :D"
"NEGATIVE", "-LED is a bit too bright on the front panel(No big deal, really) -CPU fan quit after one month of use, however, Avatar quickly helped me send in the part and get a new part sent into me. -Could use another case fan, but it works fine without it."
"NEGATIVE", "windows 8 i never use the extra features and they get in the way."
"NEGATIVE", "weak wifi, oversensitive mouse pad, require some tweaking s to keep the PC nice and cool. Colors don't look as vibrant as iPad."
"NEGATIVE", "Asus's engineers must really not realize what their products go through. I sent my zenbook back for repair of the micro HDMI port, got it back, and it's intermittent. At least it kind of works now. Come on, guys. Get the with the program. If you're going to provide ports, PLEASE make sure that they are sturdy enough to stand up to use. If you can't do that, then don't bother putting them on. Motorola managed to find a way to make a micro port that doesn't fail. Why can't you, Asus?"
"NEGATIVE", "Apparently some ux31a's come with the decent ADATA ssd's, and some come with old, slow SanDisk ssd's. I got a SanDisk. It is complete garbage. And you don't know what hard drive you're getting before buying. You might get lucky, but if you're like me and you got unlucky, all you can do is resent the fact that you bought a product from an irresponsible manufacturer like ASUS -- a company that disregards quality control and has no problem deceiving the consumer."
"NEGATIVE", "I didn't really like windows 8. But I'm just using Linux anyway, so this didn't really matter. I'm also weary about the durability of the computer as mentioned by others. So far, however, I have had no issues with broken inputs or anything."
"NEGATIVE", "The trackpad sucks pretty bad. It works just fine, unlike the old reviews of the Y500, but pressing the buttons is very clumsy."
"NEGATIVE", "Heat does become an issue if playing demanding games. There is no optical drive so make sure you are ok with that before ordering. Touchpad isn't very good to my liking."
"NEGATIVE", "Trackpad is a little funky at first, but you can uninstall the gesture software. Battery, about 3 hours. (It's a full blown gaming PC in a sleek laptop. Battery will not be long of course.)"
"NEGATIVE", "Windows 8 is horrible."
"NEGATIVE", "Windows 8 and Trackpad takes some getting used to"
"NEGATIVE", "Windows 8 and Trackpad takes some getting used to"
"NEGATIVE", "None so far!"
"NEGATIVE", "Screen has a very tight viewing angle. Hard drive is fairly noisy."
"NEGATIVE", "I have not found one Con with this computer."
"NEGATIVE", "This Avatar died more times before 9AM than most do all day... I live close to an airport, and every 10 or 15 minutes or so I hear the planes come and go. The fans on this Avatar make the same noise, it just never stops. My machine shuts off around every 15 minutes due to a memory error. It seems that Avatar's QC failed the memory test on this poor Avatar. I'll be returning this Avatar tomorrow and get another iBUYPOWER computer, which I've had much better experience with.."
"NEGATIVE", "Don't really have any Cons yet ;)"
"NEGATIVE", "- VERY POOR customer service"
"NEGATIVE", "Will not even start up. (even after checking all cables)"
"NEGATIVE", "Pre-installed with Windows 8 and nearly impossible to remove due to the BIOS+GPT combination they've cooked up. Slow SSD, I feel like I was ripped off because I thought I was buying an ultrabook. Computer completely stopped charging last night. No idea why but I've noticed other people saying the same thing's happened to them. I'd guess it's due to flimsy internal construction."
"NEGATIVE", "Keyboard started to become nonresponsive after 1 month. After 3 months it became non-responsive quite frequently during the day. User reviews say the keyboard soldering is very bad. Touchpad is poorly placed. This machine seems to have been rushed to market at the expense of quality testing."
"NEGATIVE", "windows 8!. i thought i would like windows 8, but like an old dog and new tricks, it has been a steep learning curve, hence frustrating. also, no windows 8 disk for reinstal."
"NEGATIVE", "The keyboard and mousepad are not as nice as Macbook Air. The screen is nice but not quite good as retina display. I can still see the pixels. Some bloatwares but I uninstalled most of them. Windows 8 is driving me crazy. I hope Asus will offer a downgrade. So far I haven't seen the problems other people mentioned. I will update this review once I encounter any problem."
"NEGATIVE", "The external ports ARE EXTREMELY FRAGILE. I had it hooked up to my TV via the micro HDMI jack, and it wore out after a MONTH!!. It no longer works unless you position the cable exactly right, and it's extremely annoying. I looked up some pictures online of the internals, and the jacks aren't supported in the least. They're just some razor thin sheet metal hanging off the edge of the PCB. The USB and SD slots look like they're sturdy enough to stand up to every day use, but the Micro HDMI port and VGA port are far too thin and fragile to stand up to any use."
"NEGATIVE", "Touchpad while i was happy it wasn't the elan one alot of people has had problems with. i really hate the buttons being built into the pad. the harddrive is really slow but atleast u got alot of space i guess"
"NEGATIVE", "The touch pad is a bit clumsy, but who is going to use the touchpad with this thing. Screen would be better if matte: like all glossy screens, it's an exercise in frustration to use outdoors or in direct light."
"NEGATIVE", "None outside of what was listed in my previous review."
"NEGATIVE", "None."
"NEGATIVE", "none so far, Windows 8 is a little difficult in getting used to."
"NEGATIVE", "Having serious problems with Linux drivers for the touchpad. Very little documentation out there, and can't find any other Linux users of this laptop."
"NEGATIVE", "None"
"NEGATIVE", "Seriously, this laptop crushes it, I couldn't find any legitimate cons."
"NEGATIVE", "hardware failure first month, dell sent a pickup tag, and repaired it. but then software (OS?) failed and machine won't restart. dell sent out a recovery DVD. what's the problem with that? the machine does not have a dvd drive, uses usb flash drive. supposedly dell is sending out a usb flash drive."
"NEGATIVE", "network unreliable"
"NEGATIVE", "the laptop doesn't work after 3 month I bought it. the test shows there is something wrong with the video card."
"NEGATIVE", "video memory failed, notebook would not boot due to this failure. Unusable now. Will try RMA, but all my data will be lost."
"NEGATIVE", "Windows 8 is strange, but after having it for just over a day I'm already used to it though, and it's actually pretty cool. Other than that, there are no cons."
"NEGATIVE", "Windows 8 is kind of a pain to get used to but supposedly will becoming more user-friendly pending the 8.1 update, the blue LED light on the front of the case is really bright and probably will be seeing a piece of electrical tape in the near future, included mouse and keyboard are garbage and should only be used as a back-up. I don't think this machine is as quiet as other users have reported - it's not loud, but it's not silent either."
"NEGATIVE", "Windows 8 takes some getting used to. But if this is how windows will be from now on, better get used to it right now. Other than that, there are no cons YET."
"NEGATIVE", "No major cons, really, only small inconveniences that were easily ignored or fixed. Keyboard and mouse, though decent, are flimsy, the angling tabs on the back of the keyboard broke off within a week, but that's not really a problem. Computer was unable to connect to my house's wireless network, unfortunately, but I just manually connected it to my router, which was no big deal. It got accidentally shipped to my neighbor's house, but again, since it came a day earlier than I was expecting, no complaints. I still got it that day. Item tracking was made very easy by newegg. Again, no big cons, I still highly recommend this computer to anyone looking for a somewhat-more-than-entry-level gaming PC."
"NEGATIVE", "Unfortunately, after 5 days of use the laptop died; I'll get into that in a minute. While the laptop was working, I went ahead and replaced the 500 GB hard drive with a 240 GB SSD and used a 750 GB for data. I planned to create the recovery DVDs like I have for clients with Windows 7 on ASUS laptops and then recover it onto the SSD. Since there was little bloatware, it would just make my life simplier. I was dissappointed that ASUS no longer provides the AI Recovery application in Windows 8. It's one thing to not provide a recovery DVD or Windows 8 (no manufacturer does that anymore), but to not give the ability to create them is frustrating to say the least. So I cloned the stock drive onto the SSD and added the 750 GB drive. I am glad I planned to do it that way, because I was also disappointed to see that ASUS is using Hitachi Hard drives!? Plus the drive was over 1 year old! After setting the laptop up exactly as I wanted and was confident all my programs installed and worked well, I began the task of transferring data to the laptop. Before doing so, I rebooted the system and it would not come back on. The laptop powered on, the keyboard lit up and the power button was on, but nothing else happened. No post, nothing. After trying a few things, I contacted ASUS Customer Service. The tech had me unplug the laptop and remove the battery (which I already tried) and he had me hold the power button for 30 seconds before replacing the battery and plugging it in again. I wasn't sure what that would do, but it didn't help. The tech told me I could return it to NewEgg since I just bought it or I could return it to ASUS for repair."
"NEGATIVE", "From time to time, especially the first time i launch a game the screen does this flickering, just flashing on and off really quickly and the game lags to hell during the procress. I have to exit out of the game and start it up again every time. Really disappointed in this laptop"
"NEGATIVE", "Bad sound, random freezes, low battery life"
"NEGATIVE", "Took 2 stars off because my screen does this flickering from time to time, its highly irritating and the most recent one had my computer running really bad,"
"NEGATIVE", "Somewhat outdated technology, heavy, and short battery life."
"NEGATIVE", "Motherboard, like those on a few other reviewers computers, failed after several months. Dell will replace it but it's still a hassle."
"NEGATIVE", "Own this for 5 months now, was planning to give it as a gift but it didn't go through. I started using it recently and found that the wireless card is junk. Its made by Intel (model: Centrino 2230) and they are usually good stuff but not the one in these Dell. It would stall on websites even though it shows that it has full bars, but sometimes it wouldn't even connect at all from a cold start. You can Google the 2230 and there are quite a bit of post on this failure from Intel. Have problem with the touch pad, it would randomly stop to responding."
"NEGATIVE", "Very loud fan. for such a small machine the fan is simply obnoxious. I am not sure if there was something wrong with my particular computer, but I could not watch videos - the fan would invade the sound. I have returned the computer."
"NEGATIVE", "flimsy port covers that are purely aesthetic, just rip them off windows8 (recommend rebuild with win7)"
"NEGATIVE", "The computer lasted 9 weeks and the motherboard died called tech support 800-624-9896 and they are sending me a fedex box postage paid and they will fix the issue and they promised not to touch the hard drive"
"NEGATIVE", "Wireless is too bad, always gets disconnected from Internet. Even when try connecting to wireless network manually, it says network issues. I never thought Dell releases such bad laptop.. I had a very good opinion on dell lapts ant now NOT. Another con is win8"
"NEGATIVE", "It kept restarting every 10 min or so. I tried multiple things to resolve the issue, but no luck. So I tried calling the customer service but no one ever answered and there was no option to leave a voice mail."
"NEGATIVE", "Needs additional fans."
"NEGATIVE", "If you plan on buying an 8320/8350 as a new cpu, you'll need to upgrade to a larger stronger motherboard. It's a small con for me, but the 6100 that's in it won't bottleneck any middle end cards, so you can upgrade it's GPU pretty well until you need an upgrade."
"NEGATIVE", "The GPU started having driver issues only a couple hours into use. I stopped playing Diablo, went to desktop and started browsing the web when I suddenly had 'driver has crashed and recovered' several times, until it didn't recover anymore. PC restarted and I couldn't get any detection on the GPU. Error code 43's. Very disappointed in no fix helped that I tried even a full reinstall of Win8 and drivers directly from disk after completely wiping the HDD. I had very minimal use of the GPU so I know it didn't overheat or anything, and if it did that would be ridiculous. And no I didn't overclock, because I have never done that and don't want to fry a card. The only thing I didn't try was reseating the GPU, because I didn't want to void my warranty on the RMA. I had the bad luck of a faulty GPU, or maybe an issue with the PCI-E slot, but most likely the GPU according to a very helpful Avatar Tech. Avatar have been great so far in their customer support to me, so I don't know why some people knocked Eggs on them. But with no working GPU, this PC functions as a basic PC for the price tag it is. Not what I bought it for."
"NEGATIVE", "have had it over 5 weeks and cannot send it back but cannot play games due to display driver malfunction. No one at New Egg really offered to help and told me to contact Lenovo about it. Not happy with NEW EGG. I have spent $100 to get this fixed but still not fixed."
"NEGATIVE", "Lots of bloatware to uninstall, also download a program called GeForce Experience, my cards didn't have the updated drivers so I used this program to; its good to keep on the computer."
"NEGATIVE", "Not a big fan of the touch pad. I usually never use them anyways."
"NEGATIVE", "Not a con, but may help. No wireless connection straight out of the box. Could see router, but unable to connect. Ended up using ethernet and a complete uninstall of the wireless drivers. Rebooted and voila..."
"NEGATIVE", "N/A"
"NEGATIVE", "This thing is BIG! But if you are gaming, you know what you are getting. Power brick is big and also heavy. Doesn't come with Bluray but I used that close to never in my other laptop."
"NEGATIVE", "none that i can see"
"NEGATIVE", "Bloatware. Oh my, the bloatware. Removed every trace of it and saw an immediate increase in start up and speeds."
"NEGATIVE", "Lose 1/2 egg for the port covers and 1/2 for the LCD. The port covers are a joke and I leave a USB receiver for a mouse plugged in so the one cover is always sticking out. I'm sure they are either going to break off, or it might just cut them off. I think they should have gone with a more basic design, but they don't really affect anything. The LCD has a pressure point in the lower left corner that ripples out like you were poking it with your finger when you pull on the lid to close it. I don't forse this becoming an issue, but it is just annoying. No keyboard backlight and there isn't an option to buy a different keyboard that has one right now."
"NEGATIVE", "like so many others.. the wireless connection is intermittent if at all. After calling Dell support and using the computer a few times, they said, well it could be a hardware problem, but it is probably a software problem and that is not our problem, it's yours.. excuse me?? the only thing I downloaded was itunes and now they are saying a computer software issue is my problem not theirs.. I always stayed away from Dell, but thought, hey this looks like it's just what I need.. but what I need is internet... and now, dell won't stand behind a computer that is 2 weeks old... I'm shocked and so unimpressed with Dell's customer service that wasted 1.25 hours of my life, only to hear, buy our extended warranty and we'll delve further into your problem"
"NEGATIVE", "the laptop wouldn't boot after a month of very light use."
"NEGATIVE", "port covers... I know it's been said and you may think no big deal... I'll just rip them off... but the laptop will not look right without them, and with them... it's just a serious, serious pain."
"NEGATIVE", "Bought for the wife as an early Mothers day gift, installed MS products and she was just getting over the frustration of Windows 8 - and then it died. Less than a weeks worth of use. Dell is sending someone out to fix next week (prob MB failure)"
"NEGATIVE", "Black and grey horizontal lines on black areas of the screen. Noticed that the quality of the cutscenes on games are a bit choppy."
"NEGATIVE", "It wouldnt work right out of the box. $1400 and it wouldnt even turn on. The keyboard display would light up and the dvd player would click on and that was it. Called Tech Support and they said it was a bad computer to send it back in for a replacement. Wouldnt be *as* annoyed if this was a measly $600 laptop...we are talking about $1400 here, it should work right out of the box!!!!"
"NEGATIVE", "Extremely huge. Be forewarned, it's as thick as notebooks were in the 90s, and almost as wide as your regular widescreen monitor. So that makes it a hefty piece of hardware to just carry around. Note, newegg does not accept returns on these. We looked inside the box, decided it was too big to use, but then were out of luck when trying to exchange it for a smaller model. BTW, this is probably the most hilarious part of the description 'Windows® 8 has been reimagined to be all about you. Put what matters most right on your Start screen, and get instant access to your people, apps, and stuff, so you can spend less time searching and more time Doing.' Riiiight. This has to be the most ironic statement Microsoft has released. So to summarize cons: 1. Too Big 2. Too Heavy 3. Has Windows 8 4. No returns/exchanges on Newegg (something they omit mentioning)"
"NEGATIVE", "The machine is much slower than I expected. No cd drive. Lenovo support was very deceiving. Had me on the phone for 45 minute THEN told me I needed to pay $168.00 for software support. The unit locked up so many times that not even the Task Manager would work! Was hung up on after I asked for a supervisor. Then I simply gave up. My IT guy misled me with Lenovo."
"NEGATIVE", "Trackpad click buttons are also within trackpad limits, clicking left or right will displace pointer from current position. Intel Centrino N2230 WiFi adapter is very weak compared to my previous 3 year old laptop's Atheros card. It's hard to get good range and speed from it. Surface is prone to smudges easily."
"NEGATIVE", "Windows 8, Finger print manget, poor monitor assembly. What I mean by poor monitor assembly, is that the bezel surrounding the display is held together by glue. Upon removing the shiny plastic from the bezel, it became apparent that (possibly from Summer Heat in UPS truck?) the glue started to roll onto the display leaving globs that were difficult to remove. I had to carefully use a wooden tooth pick and tweezers to remove one and the other I could not get rid of since there was still a considerable amount adhered to the bezel. I had to use the toothpick to push it back under the bezel. That's why this Notebook gets 4 Stars! Trackpad left and right click are integrated to the touchpad, scares me a little to use it because if you use the corners of the left and right click, it sinks down more than it should in comparison to pressing more towards the center."
"NEGATIVE", "* Comes pre-installed with a lot of Asus bloatware (But this was easy to uninstall). * Comes with a 500 GB HHD but would have liked to see a SSD just big enough for boot up (As I stated before it takes about 10 seconds or less to boot up, I'm just being picky here). * Stock speakers aren't that good. I planned on buying a surround sound entertainment system anyways so this isn't an issue for me."
"NEGATIVE", "With any pre-built pc you know you’re going to get bloatware, the G75 being no exception. Would have been nice had this model contained even a small solid state boot drive, but there was another model that did and I got this one so I don’t really have the right to complain. I removed the main bottom panel which allows access to the drive bays and RAM, and although it is nice that all of that is only one screw away, I felt like I was going to break the bottom panel as I tried to gingerly pry it away from the chassis. The 4 USB 3.0 ports all work properly, however (me being nit-picky) they gave some resistance to the insertion of a USB device, so if you find yourself almost forcing your flash drive in, make sure it’s right side up and don’t be afraid to give it a (gentle!) shove."
"NEGATIVE", "The main problem I'll give this laptop is its shoddy quality control. I've owned this laptop for about 10 months, 7 of which it was resting in storage while I was deployed so that it wouldn't be damaged by the not-so-computer friendly environment in afghanistan while I was deployed. Upon returning I tried to hook it up to my tv using a hdmi cable to watch a dvd with on my tv with it. The laptop will not even recognize that another screen/monitor/device is hooked up to it. I've checked and updated all of my driver to insure that they are the latest versions, as well as trying fn + f8, nvidia control panel, and windows display settings. All show no external device being added. Is it so hard to check that all the physical ports on a device are working before you ship it out?"
"NEGATIVE", "plastic port covers are annoying. When you plug in headphones, you have to tell the computer they're default in the settings to get sound thru them, and override the unit speakers. I have no idea why plugging in headphones does NOT override the external speakers automatically like every other computer?? i've searched & searched online and at Dell to figure out how to get this port to function properly, and to date, no luck."
"NEGATIVE", "My Laptop came with no charger. I mailed the unit back on 4/24/2013 and was told you have to wait for another 2-3 weeks to get your new replacement back. I have never in my life seen taking this long to get your defective product replacement back to the client. Shame on the management not taking care of this within 10 days. Thanks, Anil Tandon"
"NEGATIVE", "Design is very bad. Have small plastic covers for USB and other ports. Which can break easily and stop closing. Thats what happened with me. Keyboard is very had and difficult to use. Decide urself. Having lots of plastic parts creates an issue for me"
"NEGATIVE", "windows 8 does take some time to get used to."
"NEGATIVE", "Wireless Card no good. Intermittent would not hold a signal, even right next to my new Hi-Tech router which works perfect with all our other computers in house. Tested out also at Starbucks and MCD, with same issues. Spent HOURS on tel with Del;, and still could never get properly operational."
"NEGATIVE", "None"
"NEGATIVE", "Dell and more importantly Newegg should be ashamed of themselves for not recalling this piece of trash. It's 2013. What is the point of having a laptop that can't handle wireless? With a perfect wireless connection this laptop takes between 30 seconds and a minute to load a website if you are lucky. Wireless on this laptop is absolutely defective and apparently it is a known issue. Don't take my word for it, go look."
"NEGATIVE", "I think the only thing I would improve is I would have added a latch to keep the lid firmly clamped down when in transport."
"NEGATIVE", "Although I was prepared to RMA this baby right back to newegg, Everything worked out better than expected. After getting this thing just where I like it I'm only left with a handful of minor issues. These are not bad enough in my opinion to warrant a return. 1. Horizontal lines. These appear when the screen is very dark. It seems like it only happens sometimes and must be software related. The best way I could explain them would be, dark-grey and black fighting over who gets to represent black on my screen. It is very fine, and only bothers me when I am playing a game that is very dark. After I googled the issue I found a patch. BAM. fixed. then later it appeared again. Then I resorted to uninstalling the software that was suppose to be responsible for the lines and BAM. fixed again. But they have now returned and I have all but given up. Once more. They are not so bad that they ruin my computing experience but I could see a situation where someone would think so. 2. Throttling while on battery. If you unplug this beast you will immediately notice that the CPU speed drops from a whopping 3.xxGHz to a useless 0.7GHz. I did not spend a lot of time trying to figure this out because I don't plan on unplugging this computer for anything except to move it from one room to another. I tried changing power plans and disabling ASUS software but to no avail. Must be BIOS related. If you plan on using this computer while it is unplugged, you should make sure there is a fix for this before you purchase this computer. It is basically a 17inch netbook when its unplugged. 3. Fingerprints. I understood through reviews that this thing was a fingerprint magnet. That is not the problem. I have hands that always seem to stay damp so Its not unusual for me to leave prints everywhere. The fingerprints that appear on this computer are not easy to clean. An example: go get a piece of scotch tape and take the sticky side and put your fingerprint on it. cool right? now try and clean that piece of tape so that its transparent again. Not easy right? Well that's how easy it is to clean them off the lid of this computer. I would have better luck peeling mosquitoes off of a glue trap. 4. Back light bleeding through on borders of screen. When I make my screen black, I can see light bleeding through on the sides. In my opinion the screen is the worst part of this laptop. Could have been better quality but its not so bad that I constantly notice it. Still useable."
"NEGATIVE", "No cd drive. I have to get an external drive just to install discs or to us cd's."
"NEGATIVE", "Not having a optical drive is not necessary but some what handy for a kid without a credit card or any means to buy online."
"NEGATIVE", "I cannot make a recovery disk to restore the OS to a new disk."
"NEGATIVE", "The single con is still the same as before: The trackpad. This, by no means, decreases its appeal since 99% of users for a gaming laptop want a mouse. Also, apple owns a few patents for the single finger/dual finger clicking mouse pad so I am guessing that's why Lenovo didn't do that here?"
"NEGATIVE", "It's a bit heavy and you only get good performance when the laptop is plugged into the charger. No big deal for me because I don't plan to travel much with it."
"NEGATIVE", "Audio is bad. Worse than advertised. And one of the speakers blew 2 months into it."
"NEGATIVE", "screen"
"NEGATIVE", "not a con per se but just know that it's a heavy heavy laptop. Think of it more as a portable computer than a laptop. would be nice to have a solid state drive or at least an option."
"NEGATIVE", "Full of bloatware and does not come with a windows 8 CD to preform a clean install. SUPER angry right now having to find win8 online to clean my computer."
"NEGATIVE", "no cons yet"
"NEGATIVE", "The monitor. In my first review (premature apparently) I lauded the excellent monitor. That's because, when it was brand new it looked fantastic. 2 months later, I am experiencing faint vertical lines across the entire panel, most noticeably in dark areas. I have tried every available driver release to no avail. After searching the problem, I have learned it's quite common. Asus are quite aware of the problem and RMA's only results in a replacement of the same brand/manufacturer panel that is clearly a manufacturing defect in a VERY large percentage coming from this plant. ROG forums are full of same complaints, loaded with multiple RMA's only to continue to have the same problem. I'm not going to bother with an RMA given Asus just replaces the panel with the exact same panel that has problems. All the meanwhile, my $1400 is in shipping more than it is in my possession. Last ASUS product for me."
"NEGATIVE", "occasional wlan and touchpad disconnection Newegg's policy : no refund, RMA is denied I see disconnections of wifi and touchpad. Everytime I turn on the laptop, Windows repeats to figure out its touchpad connection."
"NEGATIVE", "The keyboard on many new Dell laptops suck! The keys are not spaced properly, the keyboard is not offset well but most importantly, if you are a power keyboard user, the lack of a dedicated home/end/pg up/down keys is horrible. What were they thinking when they eliminated those keys? Many other brands feature a row with those keys to the far right. With Dell, you need to use two hands, one to press the Fn key and the other to control the dual function keys. I hate it!"
"NEGATIVE", "There are cover on the usb, hdmi ports, It is difficulut to open and creates pressure to the connector if the laptop is not on a good flat surface this will contibute to early port failure in the future. Screen only look good if you look at correct angle, view angle is very limited but that come with low cost laptop"
"NEGATIVE", "None so far"
"NEGATIVE", "It can only do Minecraft at ultra low settings. Port covers (debating on ripping them off or just waiting for them break off.) Trackpad is not large enough to swipe completely down to close an application in Windows 8, so I mostly Alt+F4 to do it. And I don't know if it's Windows 8 or what, but when I press down arrow or arrow left, right, I like my view to scroll!"
"NEGATIVE", "Annoying screen flicker, which ASUS suggested to update the Nvidia drivers, which i did to no avail. Later i adjusted the refresh rate down from 60hz to 40hz which seems to have done the trick. The touch pad is larger than I'm accustomed, coming from an hp dv7t, I occasionally catch it with my palm which typically causes it to switch to another running app/window (windows 8 'feature' i suppose). Comes with windows 8. Appears Microsoft is attempting to turn my laptop/desktop into a tablet, which i don't appreciate. Received Windows BAD_POOL_HEADER error / crash just earlier today (maybe memory / maybe windows). date/time continued to change to previous day, which was resolved by changing internet time sync from time.windows.com to time.nist.gov."
"NEGATIVE", "This thing loves to eat battery but for any gaming laptop it will be that way. if you want to game game plugged in."
"NEGATIVE", "The original 5400rpm drive. Also the laptop is rather large, I know it's a 17' display but the rest of the laptop feels bigger than it needs to be. Touchpad 'smart gestures' is annoying I turned it off since I would brush the touchpad when typing and bring up the menu. The ASUS drivers are locked for Windows 8 only."
"NEGATIVE", "Unacceptably bad hardware, ranging from an inconsistent keyboard to a trackpad that has to be manually uninstalled to be disabled."
"NEGATIVE", "Windows 8. Dear aquabuddha windows 8 sucks."
"NEGATIVE", "touchpad sucks"
"NEGATIVE", "heavy. but not a big deal"
"NEGATIVE", "Some keys from the keyboard are very small and you will need to get used to it. Like the Enter.. Is VERY SMALL! This is not a con but I would love to have Media keys. It only has Vol up and Vol down. It would have been very nice it they have had added the Play, Next and back keys and mute key. Another thing to have in mind is the size of th charger. Its quite big. Oh and yes... its a fingerprint magnet and can be a little annoying, for me."
"NEGATIVE", "No touchscreen with Windows 8, 1080p makes things too small on the 15.6' screen, keyboard is cramped, touchpad SUCKS; you can't press a button without moving the cursor, so you end up clicking on things all but where you want."
"NEGATIVE", "-- Heavy (that is expected with a laptop like this one). I knew what i wanted so, no worries here. -- Short Battery Life: I really hope ASUS addresses this because although for a week now, I have had my laptop plugged in most of the time, and I am not doing anything too intensive, except for browsing. Even with all of this power, they have to balance this... I tried darkening my screen and using the battery saving feature while I work. -- Bloatware: I ended up blanking the hard drive and doing a fresh install."
"NEGATIVE", "well this laptop is not portable by any means well over 8 pounds...cant complaint because its desktop replacement. you will need a desk for it. track pad is not suitable for gaming, you will need a mouse. i didnt get blueray with mine :("
"NEGATIVE", "The Screen on this laptop is HORRIBLE! For a 1920x1080 display at 17.3' I figured the screen would be beautiful! However, as soon as I turned the laptop on my eyes started to cross. I could see very faint vertical lines across the entire screen. The lines seem to be most prominent when the screen displays colors around light-blue and green, however you can see the lines on most colors that have ANY green in them. I took some macro (close up) pictures of my screen so I could see the pixels making up the image and found the issue causing the problem. Here's what I found. All pixels on standard LCD screen are made up of RED GREEN and BLUE sub-pixels. Pixels are arranged in a grid pattern across the entire screen... So a 1920x1080 screen will have 1920 columns of pixels from left to right across the screen and 1080 rows of pixels from top to bottom. That makes for a total of 2,073,600 individual pixels on a 1920x1080 screen. Looking at the picture I took of the monitor displaying a light blue color I can see that every other column of pixels is displaying a green sub-pixel that is brighter than its neighbor column. For Example: Let's say we have a screen with a resolution of 5x5 pixels representated by the figure below. Each 'RGB' is a pixel. The columns with the lower case 'g' are the problem columns that are causing the lines on the screen. RGB RgB RGB RgB RGB RGB RgB RGB RgB RGB RGB RgB RGB RgB RGB RGB RgB RGB RgB RGB RGB RgB RGB RgB RGB 1 2 3 4 5"
"NEGATIVE", "Honestly, I will not list any cons here because the item is exactly as described, all features function normally and I love everything about it. See other thoughts. However, I do recommend skipping on the NewEgg Warranty and instead just purchase the warranty through Dell. NewEgg warranty is a no hassle process, but they will refund the cost of the purchase (minus the warranty of course) almost 100% of the time in my experience. It also is not on-site service where as with Dell, you can get 2 day on-site repair and not have to mail it back and forth to the depot. Highly recommend to go that route, just register online at dell.com and register this laptop there and then upgrade support. And, as I ran out of room below - I also highly recommend Shop Runner (shoprunner.com) as it costs $79 a year for unlimited free 2 day shipping and easy return shipping also. All of the below items I got using Shop Runner, which paid for the entry cost and Newegg always had the products out to me in 3 days. I have been shopping with NewEgg for over 5 years, just keep in mind that if you purchase items through them, they will stand behind their products. I hope this entire review was helpful."
"NEGATIVE", "Keyboard is not reliable... often misses characters as you type, even though you ht the key (and yes, I typed 'hit', not 'ht'). It's extremely frustrating to have to correct these errors constantly. BIOS was a bit frustrating as I installed an SSD, installed Windows 8 on this SSD and then attempted to point the BIOS to the new OS only. I know and love BCDEdit, but it was a pain to identify the device and bootloader that I needed in the BIOS. Got things working after much trial and error. No separate volume or media player controls, forcing you to use Fn key combinations to change the volume. Touch pad is a bit wonky... but can be disabled when you plug in a mouse. Comes with Windows 8."
"NEGATIVE", "5400 RPM drive thats it"
"NEGATIVE", "The F key is less reliable than the text pad on my 5 year-old flip-phone, usually taking at least 2 taps to work, and sometimes as many as 20. All the other keys work fine. Just a really surprising thing to have wrong right out of the undamaged box."
"NEGATIVE", "The mouse pad sucks! The mouse pad sucks! This had to be said twice to emphasis the suckyness of the mouse pad. (gaming I use as mouse {DUH}, but I also use this as a laptop, in my lap, topping with it) It does not have webpage scroll option (where you drag you finger on the edge of the mouse pad to scroll up and down on web pages) The left and right mouse button area is used as part of the mousepad. So if you are trying to click on stuff, the pointer moves. I have all my settings on small to fit more stuff on the screen, so this is a problem when my [X] box is small and the pointer moves away from it when i try to click. Oh My Stars... the fingerprints - this is tests my patients to the max with fingerprints!!! I might just spray paint the lid of this thing to keep me sane."
"NEGATIVE", "Suck cause can't play anything without the charger plug in...fps will drop way too low when it's not plug in...can't find any way to fix this problem...so if your out with your laptop on battery all it could do is surf the Webb..."
"NEGATIVE", "stuff may get stuck between the touchpad and the chassis."
"NEGATIVE", "-only complaint is how easy it is to leave smudges and finger prints but it looks so pretty I don't mind"
"NEGATIVE", "Mouse pad does feel a bit cheaper made than the rest of the unit Graphic Driver Update issues Windows 8 No optical drive."
"NEGATIVE", "The laptop comes with Windows 8 which still has compatibility issues and bugs. It comes pre-loaded with: trial software, bloatware, and badly designed update software that can corrupt your system and cause various issue. The LCD failed after a few hours of light use. I have set up an RMA, but now I will have to wait (guessing several weeks) before I can get it back and start using it."
"NEGATIVE", "It is heavy, but not really a con as you can see what it weighs when you are buying it."
"NEGATIVE", "There is something seriously wrong with the USB on this machine. Minidump points to this everytime it BSOD's and it happens once every couple of days. I have gone so far as to see if it was Win 7 64bit, Win 8, SSD vs Mechanical Drive. Mouse manufacturer between two mice, Audio interface vs no interface. Driver updates from Asus vs directly from Intel. BIOS Update. There is no difference, BSOD on iusb3mon. Not really sure how much more I can do to remediate this issue beyond waiting for better USB drivers If it were not for this issue it would get 5 stars easily!"
"NEGATIVE", "AC Adapter is dead. I could live with that, and Asus probably would have crossed shipped to me. I didn't want this model, I bought the same model but with the 2.30ghz and win7 and it's wonderful. But Newegg limits to one per customer and I took a chance on this one. After updating drivers for the video card and downgrading I eventually plugged into an external monitor to realize that the friggin vertical lines are most likely in the display so that's shot as well. Opened a pre sale ticket wth newegg days ago to see if I could avoid this unit (24 hr response yeah right) I've spent plenty of money with newegg, time to pay a bit more and go to a newer more reliable firm."
"NEGATIVE", "Cheap construction after a week of owner ship scratches started appearing on the body of the laptop. Mouse is nice but is in the way at time especially for developers, the software that is supposed to ignore touch when typing seems to rarely work Im missing 2 screws on the underside of the laptop have no idea why or how. 2 Months into laptop my ac adapter stopped working.... No idea why I placed my bag down on the floor once a little to hard and the laptop inside my bag inside its custom case got dented in the corner ( strictly aesthetic no damage to performance ). The first order I got with this laptop I had a pink display and could not fix not to mention random keys on my keyboard did not work. I returned it promptly and got the replacement that im reviewing. Memory / Harddrive not up-gradable without voiding warranty"
"NEGATIVE", "Be prepared for Ultra envy if this is gift for someone other then yourself…"
"NEGATIVE", "Can't seem to boot from USB. Bios doesn't even have it as an option. Backlight bleed all over the bottom edges of the screen. I RMA'd the first one because of the bleed and the second one has the same issue. Space bar is much harder to press than all the other keys. It could be a great device, but the quality control is really terrible."
"NEGATIVE", "The track pad is just a bit jumpy, but not horribly so. I typically use a small wireless mouse anyway, though a couple of times the track pad picked up my thumb hovering a little too close. There is a little bit of bloat, but nothing too extensive and it's pretty easy to take care of. As a previous review mentioned, the fan can get a little loud, but nothing horrible."
"NEGATIVE", "Got my first one DOA."
"NEGATIVE", "Battery Life. As much as I know this is a never ending topic the 3.5 hour battery life doesn't seem to cut it for a machine with this amount of power."
"NEGATIVE", "There was a bit of substance leaking out from LCD screen. A little cleanup was required, no other mess. I would also agree with the other reviews in regards to quality of touch pad. It is a bit more flimsy at the left and right click button areas then you would expect. But seeing as I will be using it for more of last resort and using a bluetooth mouse I bought on sale. It is not a huge hassle."
"NEGATIVE", "have had it over 5 weeks and cannot send it back but cannot play games due to display driver malfunction. No one at New Egg really offered to help and told me to contact Lenovo about it. Not happy with NEW EGG. I have spent $100 to get this fixed but still not fixed."
"NEGATIVE", "None outside of what was listed in my previous review."
"NEGATIVE", "Pumps out some serious hot air when gaming, but that is to be expected 2 graphics cards kicking tail at the same time. If this is your main machine you will be investing in some type of device to keep the hot exhaust off your hands."
"NEGATIVE", "-Yes, the mousepad is horrible. After a bunch of tweaking to all sorts of different settings, I got it to a reasonable level of functionality. But for gaming, everyone uses a mouse anyways, so it won't be much of an issue -I guess it's kind of a con, no optical drive. But they had to make room for the 2nd 650m, so, no worries. You can download everything nowadays anyways -**How completely locked down this thing is**"
"NEGATIVE", "The laptop doesnt work properly and Ive owned it for all of about 47 minutes. unbox it the keyboard keys type things at random when i hit some of the keys. For example I hit the 'H' key and instead of just typing 'H' it adds a + before the H and then types 'hfge' after the H. Or if I hit the number '7' it types 21694 ??????? This actually happens for most of the keys."
"NEGATIVE", "Windows 8 caused me not to buy this."
"NEGATIVE", "Heavy, windows eight is a bit hard to figure out just by using it but you can always google"
"NEGATIVE", "My notebook suddenly shut off without warning while composing a email. During the boot (After the ROG Logo) the screen flashed quickly orange (Managed to fix this with Nvidia's new graphics driver) Too many bloatware, uninstalled all at once. The rubberized palm rests get dirty really fast, annoying to rub off. Plus, there seems to be a sound driver issue, the volume sometimes would be strange and be lower and higher."
"NEGATIVE", "NONE...just get rid of McAfee virus scanner and get something else Laptop is all around great, sorry New Egg how could I have doubted you? ;)"
"NEGATIVE", "The touchpad seems a little unresponsive on occasion. Not really a big deal. Have to redo a gesture every once and a while. The power plug is a largish 'L' connector. Seems a bit bulkier than it should. Only 4 GB or RAM. This is the biggest complaint I have. Windows 8 does run light at only 1GB, but that doesn't leave a lot of memory for MATLAB (which can use a LOT of memory for more complex things). I know a friend who runs out of memory using MATLAB on a 12GB MAC. He does a lot of stuff with regression models and it IS a MAC."
"NEGATIVE", "Windows 8 is a pain in the you know what. And fan noise is a little loud."
"NEGATIVE", "The wifi has kicked on and off occasionally since getting it. Not our router, but could be software. Easily resolved but the only reason this gets 4 stars instead of 5. Windows 8 is best optimized on touchscreen. Sensitive keypad makes for issues with typing text sometimes."
"NEGATIVE", "I wish the system came with more RAM from the get go as I feel like 8 GB future proofs things a bit. Although the system runs great as is"
"NEGATIVE", "Honestly for the price you are paying, you are getting a great deal. The processor isn't the fastest, but its no slug. wish it had a i5 Its a new laptop, so ACER still probably has to work on some of their drivers because of users reported of freezing issues. I already fixed the issue, by updating some of the drivers, so not really a big deal. it was 529.99 when I bought it :(, now its 449.99!!! even more of a steal. Windows 8 takes some getting used to, but heard they releasing a new update soon, and will make it better for people who don't have touch screens."
"NEGATIVE", "hardware failure first month, dell sent a pickup tag, and repaired it. but then software (OS?) failed and machine won't restart. dell sent out a recovery DVD. what's the problem with that? the machine does not have a dvd drive, uses usb flash drive. supposedly dell is sending out a usb flash drive."
"NEGATIVE", "Cons: -I had it fixed on the day I got it cause something did not sound right when it is on. -5400rpm HDD"
"NEGATIVE", "Windows 8 is WHACK."
"NEGATIVE", "graphic card can only handle certain HD graphic games in medium-low setting. games like League of Legends and World of Warcraft or any anime style game is perfect speeds in High settings. only con i see is the graphics card really. ill update when i use it for a longer period of time"
"NEGATIVE", "As everyone else said, this thing is a fingerprint magnet, but that comes with having a smooth metal surface. I also don't like that the power cord has an 'L' bend to it, because in my experience power cords tend to wear down over time at the bend and eventually break inside the insulation. But oh well."
"NEGATIVE", "Overheating, Poor fan placement Softwear issues"
"NEGATIVE", "-Like Alot have said it does fingerprint up -Touch pad is flaky at best -Bloatware but could be worse -Hard to access Memory slots -horrid windows 8"
"NEGATIVE", "My only complain is the touchpad but this being a gaming laptop you would probably be using a wireless mouse so it's not biggie. It is a fingerprint magnet but it doesn't really bother me that much. It's easily cleaned."
"NEGATIVE", "Sorry I really like Newegg, But the truth is the truth....here goes The g75vw has a major power problem, if you search the ASUS message boards you can see that numerous other people are having the same issue. The laptop will randomly shutdown, no warning given just shuts down. GPUZ/Realtemp says temps are normal, Sleep and hibernation are disabled. Battery has a full charge and the power cord is securely connected. It happens all the time. Averge of 3-4 times a day. I don't do anything meaningful on that laptop anymore. I'm currently newegg to give me a full refund for this."
"NEGATIVE", "No NIC indicator lights??? I'm getting some periodic scratchy electronic noise from the analog headphone jack, not sure if it's the driver (I have the latest from the mgf site) or a hardware issue. Windows 8, but not Asus's or Newegg's fault."
"NEGATIVE", "Does come with some bloatware, but far less than I expected. Throws off some kind of electronic noise as every analog line I plug in (microphone, VGA cable, etc) experiences interference."
"NEGATIVE", "Windows 8 (Its not bad actually but I personally prefer Windows 7) GTX 670M is a rebranded 570M with higher clock speeds (This card idles at about 40-46C and tops off at 58-65C max: still very cool for a powerful card) Heavy but its not a portable laptop; its a desktop replacement FYI The 500GB HDD is partitioned as a 150 GB OS drive and a 283GB storage"
"NEGATIVE", "Build feels a bit low quality. The screen and lid bends when you open it and I even heard a popping sound. Be careful."
"NEGATIVE", "My company purchased 2 of these Zenbooks and both laptops LCD displays quit working within a month or 2 of purchase. The laptops doing nothing but sit on a desk and utilized from 9-5 M-F. I sent the first one in for repair and 2 weeks later it was repaired, minus the inconvenience of our Sales Manager not having a laptop. Today the LCD went out in the second Zenbook, which is the Vice President of the company's machine of course, and he is not happy. According to management, it's my fault for recommending these computers to our Sales Manager and Vice President."
"NEGATIVE", "Mousepad can get in the way while typing (easily rectified by simply turning off the trackpad, however) Can get pretty hot under normal use with no viable external cooling solution Lack of dock support (understandable though, so not really a major con) Battery drains pretty quickly so I'm running power pretty much constantly"
"NEGATIVE", "I purchased this computer 1 month ago and the SSD has already crashed and is completely unresponsive. A few days ago I started getting repeated blue screen on boot with the message POWER_DRIVER_STATE_ERROR. Eventually Windows diagnostic and repair managed to recover the cached files needed to boot the operating system so I am now tenuously able to start it off of the HDD. I've checked the BIOS and the information for the SanDisk SSD is now missing. I am very disappointing since these problems started exactly one month after I purchased this computer..."
"NEGATIVE", "Windows 8, though once you get used to it, it's not a big deal"
"NEGATIVE", "The mechanical Hard Drive, slow, wasting battery power."
"NEGATIVE", "totals not impressed with shipping"
"NEGATIVE", "USB ports, Speakers, Jack"
"NEGATIVE", "the usual laptop hiccups and learning what to tweak. At times it seems to think to long where it shouldn't, just web or folder browsing. Also the battery life. Still doing some more tweaks, but the battery only lasts 2-3 hours web browsing without watcgubg any videos."
"NEGATIVE", "windows 8 (who doesn't hate not having a start menu)"
"NEGATIVE", "Keyboard not terribly responsive"
"NEGATIVE", "I wish there were more USB ports, I hate using hubs. The lack of a HDD activity light bothers me, but maybe not to others. Sometimes when the computer does not seem to be 'responding' I usually look at the light to see if the disk is still being used therefore causing an unresponsive system. Many people complained about faulty keyboards and touch-pad, out of the two I have experienced no problems what so ever from both. Again this is a finger print magnet, but it doesn't bother me. Other than the above, nothing is really a flaw to me from this laptop. I like it a lot and would recommend it to others. The laptop isn't a quad core, but it does come with the SLI GT 650M's, and remember that mobile i5 processors come with HT, so it makes multi-tasking a bit easier on the CPU."
"NEGATIVE", "None so far, the only issue I had was the Display Driver issue, but I upgraded the Nvidia driver to most current and that solved the issue."
"NEGATIVE", "After adding an SSD it can be a pain to get the drive recognized to install onto but can be done once you do some research on the internet prior."
"NEGATIVE", "HDD is only 5400rpm. Comes pre-installed w/ Windows 8, which wouldn't be SO bad if this laptop had a touch screen, which it should for the price."
"NEGATIVE", "Starting 1TB HDD is horrible, but works, and I plan on replacing it. The read speed is horrible because it's a 5400RPM. Installing an SSD mSATA drive is easy physically but getting the BIOS to boot to it can be a challenge. Once RAM and SSD installed, this machine is unstoppable. Only low component I have no is the video cards giving me a 6.9 in Win8."
"NEGATIVE", "you loose a lot of graphics performance when unplugged, windows 8"
"NEGATIVE", "The build quality is not the best. On mine the left-click touchpad button was loose right out of the box and feels like its about to fall off (makes it hard to know if I actually left-clicked at all). The keyboard is also hard to type on, and often misses keystrokes."
"NEGATIVE", "The touchpad takes some getting used to... Can't think of any other cons at the time."
"NEGATIVE", "The laptop itself. And I cannot speak for any of their other products, so I wouldn't necessarily judge them entirely on this laptop. That said, if you can't do one thing right then what does that say about your other products? Laptop #1 - Arrived with a malfunctioning monitor which was determined to be a faulty cable. Returned via RMA. Laptop #2 - Arrived with a faulty mouse pad. Returned via RMA. Laptop #3 - Arrived with a faulty mouse pad. Gave up after three tries. Newegg was kind enough to give me store credit and I will be going with a 'name' brand."
"NEGATIVE", "wire to screen is continuously disconnecting"
"NEGATIVE", "Windows 8, but that's not the fault of ASUS or Newegg. No comment on the touchpad. It's good enough for a laptop, I guess. I use a regular USB mouse for games."
"NEGATIVE", "The only con I have run into is that when I hold shift, and the side of my right hand swipes from the right edge of the mouse pad, it prints a capital 'C' . Why, I have no clue, but it is getting me in the habit of being a better typist."
"NEGATIVE", "I have had a few weird issues that I think only happened to my system... First the rubber feet on the bottom of mine are not even. The laptop teeters on the top right and bottom left. I fixed this by trimming the foot down. The second issue is that the screen cover over the speaker is busted out and was getting caught on blankets, cloths... So I ended up cutting off the speaker screen as well. I could have had it sent in and fixed by Asus which is why I am not docking off an Egg. I see a few people complaining about not being able to restore the system.... Get with the times... Create your own recovery flash drive or back everything up to cloud storage(Google Drive, Skydrive). I feel this got knocked a few eggs because of uneducated users. Windows 8 is rock solid and works great, the extra 2GB of RAM help a lot for running VMs. The best way to operate windows 8 is with the keyboard short cuts. Since this isn't a tablet people will need to learn... Again not the hardware's fault for people's lack of knowledge."
"NEGATIVE", "There are only a few notable cons. First the fan is on the bottom. If you sometimes type on your lap, you can block off the vent and make the machine and your lap really warm. That being said, I'm not sure where else they had space to put it. Also, the vent goes across the entire bottom, so you likely won't block off all of it. The larger issue is the trackpad. It looks nice, but there are 2 problems. First, it's really, really big. Big is good up to a point, but it gets in the way. When you rest your hands on the laptop, they will frequently hit the top corners of the trackpad, and the palm rejection isn't great. This can be especially irritating if you're programmer. You'll be typing on one line, and then 100 lines above. The second issue is that because the pad is so big, it's really easy to click the wrong button. This isn't helped by the fact that the entire trackpad is smooth, so you can't tell by touch what part you're on. There is a black line down the center of the pad, but, like most people, I don't look at the trackpad while I use it. To give you an idea how big the trackpad is, the touchable part of my Galaxy Nexus' screen fits inside the it. Approximately 2 of the trackpads on my work Dell Latitude, which is only slightly too small, can fit inside it. It's just needlessly large."
"NEGATIVE", "Keyboard sensitivity Windows 8.0"
"NEGATIVE", "It is big for a laptop, but it is to be expected for the screen size obviously. Other than that I have no complaints about this at all"
"NEGATIVE", "little heavy, no backlit keyboard, battery life"
"NEGATIVE", "oily fingerprints appear fast. who cares, to busy looking at the screen. just keep a hanker-chief with you to wipe it down if it's really that devastating to your laptop experience. (or wash your hands)"
"NEGATIVE", "It's a tad heavier than I'd have liked, but that's not a huge concern. The power adapter truly is a brick. The thing is massive compared to other laptop chargers I've seen. 5400 RPM drive is a bit of a bummer, would have been a nice option to get this with an SSD in it instead. As others have said, the thing shows fingerprints easily, so if you have greasy hands, this laptop will make sure you know. The trackpad takes some getting used to, but it's not nearly as bad as others have said. It's sort of a bummer that it doesn't come with a DVD drive, but I have an external, so it's no big deal. It is something worth noting though, before you buy. The laptop doesn't have an extra hard drive bay, so you can't use an SSD for the OS and the 1TB drive for storage. That would have been a nice feature on a laptop this size. Doesn't come with installation media. Installing the OS on an SSD was a bad experience for me, details below."
"NEGATIVE", "Trackpad is glitchy at times Windows 8 really shines on a touch screen style device, not a more classic laptop/ultrabook build, does not support certain hardware (mice, in this case) HDD failed after 16 hours"
"NEGATIVE", "The 500 gb hard drive failed about 3 1/2 months in. I tried to RMA it but Avatar's customer support was nonexistent. I emailed them twice and called more than once. I never got a response."
"NEGATIVE", "- did some windows 8 updates and now the computer won't shutdown or sleep. when it does it won't wake up and i need to do a hard boot again -operating system installed on hardrive instead of ssd for some reason - computer came with one pixel that is 'burnt' it's not exactly burnt but it is green."
"NEGATIVE", "There were a few issues with the factory setup that were resolved after I upgraded the hard drive to an SSD and installed a fresh copy of Windows 8. - Fan control There were some problems with the fan control and power profiles out of the box. Anyone who does a bit of research about this machine will likely have heard about these issues. The fans would kick into overdrive when the laptop came out of sleep/hibernate for ten seconds or so, and then would occasionally ramp up and down repeatedly even when just browsing the web and not doing anything that would merit an increase in fan speed. Installing BIOS updates and updates to the Intel Dynamic Platform and Thermal Framework software didn't resolve this issue, but a fresh install of Windows on a new hard drive seem to have resolved it. Another part of this problem was that changes to the Power4Gear power profiles didn't seem to get saved properly initially. The default setting for minimum processor utilization in all the profiles was 100%, which is just silly. Changing this to 5% and saving would not actually save the setting, and the next time I looked at it, it would be back to 100%. This initial problem was fixed by re-installing an updated version of Power4Gear, but its a silly problem to have out of the box. - Wireless connection The wireless connection seemed to take an inordinately long time to reconnect after waking up from sleep. I could get to the desktop and have to wait 5-10 seconds before the connection was reestablished before I could use the internet. While this wasn't a huge problem, it was certainly an annoyance. This problem also seems to be resolved after having installed a fresh copy of Windows 8 on a new hard drive. - Windows scripting problems I'm not sure what happened here, but after the first month or so I ran into some problems with Active Script (Microsoft's proprietary implementation of javascript). I wasn't able to load the modern ui programs (including Windows Store stupidly enough...). I chalk this one up to Windows 8 growing pains or operator error because after a fresh install of Windows 8 on a new hard drive everything works perfectly. Be warned though, if you have problems with Windows 8, Microsoft will want more money before they provide any support... you may have better luck going through Asus, but I'm not sure I'd count on it. All things considered, while these problems shouldn't have been there out of the box, none of them were deal breakers for me, and none of them are problems anymore now that I've upgraded the hardware."
"NEGATIVE", "I am writing this second review because I could not find how to add to my other one. The machine is still sluggish. I find myself with 3 or 4 of the same thing open because I think the pad did not see my hit. It really reminds me of Vista. I believe this is a W8 problem. I hope these hints will help some of the other buyers having problems."
"NEGATIVE", "Disk drive randomly starts up and tries to read CD even when the computer is on and I'm not using it. This happens frequently... about every 10 minutes to 1 hour. The noise is annoying, but really only a minor problem. I would not want the computer to be left on in a room I sleep in though. Lots of bloatware. Example: Every time I plug in headphones it makes me select an option of whether they are headphones or microphone. Until I make the selection the headphones won't work. Several other programs also run all the time with no clear function. Keyboard layout is cramped and awkward compared to other notebooks; although, having a full numeric keypad will be nice for some."
"NEGATIVE", "Nothing to report"
"NEGATIVE", "I am completely frustrated by the fact that I cannot figure out how to boot this laptop off of either the USB port or from the internal CD/DVD drive. I updated to BIOS .409 by holding down the escape key at the same time as powering on the laptop to get into the BIOS. The boot options are not the usual HDD or DVD or USB option, but rather a predefined device and path to the boot directory in a strange nomenclature. I imagine someone at ASUS knows the way to use this method to boot off a thumb drive or DVD, unfortunately I do not see any document about this method on the ASUS support site or shipped with the laptop. I had my hopes up that I would be able to boot Linux Live DVDs to play around, and I wanted to use Clonezilla Live to back up windows 8 (there is no recovery media shipped with the laptop. Nor is there a windows license key sticker or printed certificate of authenticity (if that matters anymore?)). So in closing if it were possible to boot off the DVDrom drive or a thumb drive this laptop would be much less frustrating and a whole lot more fun. The only option I can think of is to open up the laptop and remove the hard disk and plug it into a workstation as a secondary (non-booting) drive in order to create a backup image. A windows8 generated backup made on/with the laptop is possible --but it is useless because windows depends on you to be able to boot from a device other than the HDD in order to do a restore of that backup. If the hard disk doesn't boot one morning, you are hosed. All I can do is hope there is a BIOS update in the future which allows booting off something other than the internal hard disk drive. Please ASUS, reconsider what you did to spay this nice laptop. Until then I'll set this F75VD in the corner and use my old laptop with Linux Mint."
"NEGATIVE", "Not many cons! One thing that some people may find annoying, is that the dual GeForce cards only kick in once you are on AC power. When on battery power, it uses the Intel video integrated in the CPU. This means that for certain games that don't demand much (Minecraft, WoW, etc), you might have to dial down the settings if you are playing on your battery. Con #2 would be the clickpad. With tweaking, it works well enough for coding, and everyday use. However, it is unusable when gaming due to lacking physical dedicated mouse buttons. Not a huge deal breaker, because I had planned on gaming with a mouse anyway. It is only slightly inconvienent, because sometimes you might want to run a quick daily quest, or run around in Minecraft without getting your mouse out. I hope that Lenovo adds physical mouse buttons on future Y series models like they don on their Thinkpad line. The overall length of the power cord is short. However, the cord that goes from the power brick to the wall is a standard type that can be replaced with a longer 6' for very little money. The power brick itself is pretty big due to needing to power the SLI video cards. Make sure to check out the dimensions if shopping for bags at the same time."
"NEGATIVE", "The touchpad's response is a little bit finnicky, but by no means is it bad. Don't let the touchpad performance stop you from buying this laptop. The two-finger scroll gesture takes a little getting used to and isn't quite as nice as a Macbook's two-finger scroll, but it's better than nothing."
"NEGATIVE", "Haven't found any so far. I will update my review if the machine begins to have problems."
"NEGATIVE", "Touch pad is somewhat fickle but nothing a bit of getting use to can't fix."
"NEGATIVE", "- Mini HDMI port, forcing me to buy another wire - Initial OS Setup is terrible. 32SSD is big enough for the entire OS - only 2 USB ports, 1 more would have been nice - High pitched whine can be heard... it's annoying when quiet. - A bit of PC lag when opening up programs or H/D spinning up."
"NEGATIVE", "N/A"
"NEGATIVE", "No option to create recovery disks. Despite what the ASUS mouthpiece said earlier, you cannot create a recovery ISO and disks. The manual included in the box is completely irrelevant (it seems to have been done for Windows 7 and simply put inside the Windows 8 machines). In other words, a good piece of hardware with inadequate support and software. Pretty bad leakage on the LCD too -- that's seems to have become an ASUS trademark -- all ASUS ultrabooks I've come across have terrible leakage. ASUS, you customers are paying upwards of $1,200 for this -- can't you get some quality assurance in your manufacturing?"
"NEGATIVE", "Poor keyboard (poor travel and flex) Poor battery (about 30% less than $1.2k competing ultras) Poor Wifi (range issues relative to other dual band Ns) Poor real world and benchmark speeds (the worst of all i7 ultras) bottom quarter of track-pad a dead zone lots of light bleed on screen, poor contrast and color fidelity"
"NEGATIVE", "can not back it up, can not create a system image: Error Message: There is not enough disk space to create the volume shadow copy on the storage location. Make sure that, for all volumes to be backup up, the minimum required disk space for shadow copy creation is available. This applies to both the backup storage destination and volumes included in the backup. Minimum reqirement: For volumes less than 500 megabytes, the minimum is 50 megabytes of free space. For volumes more than 500 megabytes, the minimum is 320 megabytes of free space. Recommended: At least 1 gigabyte of free disk space on each volume if volume size is more than 1 gigabyte. (0x80780119) talked to ASUS support and all they have done so far is tell me to search the web for a solution. Being that i am using this as a business computer i have to be able to back this computer up so this is a real problem and i may have to return the product which i really do not want to do to the Pros Above."
"NEGATIVE", "...hmm Thought the missing array of usb ports would hurt me. This can be solved by buying a usb octopus. but i have my turtlebeach headphones, mouse n keyboard plugged in and thats all i really need @themoment. Keyboard snaps broke in a matter of minutes *lol* but i have wireless rosewell replacements for the stock keyboard n mouse. You cant expect that stuff to last anyway, the mouse is real tiny too! (the one they send you) but it works pretty well even though i have a fat chunky hand."
"NEGATIVE", "Havent found any cons with it"
"NEGATIVE", "Windows 8 learning curb. Doesn't play Guild Wars 2 at 60 fps on the highest settings at 1080p."
"NEGATIVE", "Skeptical but open minded regarding Windows 8."
"NEGATIVE", "The ONLY con I can think of is the micro motherboard. Only one open pci slot that is directly below the video card fan vent. I am hesitant to put a card into the slot because i don't want to overheat the vid card. I was orginally going to install a wireless nic card...but in hindsight just decided to hard wire into my router."
"NEGATIVE", "None-so-far! I will admit, Windows 8 takes some getting used to, but I've got Google phones & tablets, so I can see what they are trying to do...makes sense...just be patient!"
"NEGATIVE", "Once again the power pack."
"NEGATIVE", "The only con I can think about for this computer is the quality of customer service I got from time to time and that being because some of the online chat specialists lack personality but other than this, I don't have anything negative, I feel that despite the 'tech' reviews saying the con is a cheaply made graphics card and so on... This computer gets the job done whether your a hardcore gamer on a budget or casual with some business mixed in this computer will perform decently. So honestly no cons."
"NEGATIVE", "none that I seen so far but make sure you install the stuff on the GigaByte driver such as chipsets and network stuff. This may be obvious but since im nub and did not at first it did not let me download anything from the net such as steam or game clients."
"NEGATIVE", "WINDOWS 8 can be hard to use a times."
"NEGATIVE", "Keyboard is flimsy. But what can you expect? Recommend getting a different keyboard and mouse. Also Win8. There are downloads to make Win8 work like Win7 however."
"NEGATIVE", "Keyboard is flimsy. But what can you expect? Recommend getting a different keyboard and mouse. Also Win8. There are downloads to make Win8 work like Win7 however."
"NEGATIVE", "None. I am extremely satisfied with everything."
"NEGATIVE", "Windows 8 but i knew that going into it. Getting used to it."
"NEGATIVE", "I thought Windows 8 would be a con, but it has turned out to be a decent OS."

"NEGATIVE", "Many people have Windows 8 listed as a con, and I too was worried about this. Googled, windows 8 desktop and found an 'App' for windows 8 called StartIsBack and it instantly makes your Windows 8 resemble Windows 7 Home Premium. Free for 30 days, $3 for lifetime. Problem solved."
"NEGATIVE", "none so far"
"NEGATIVE", "Computer goes black for a bit and computer restarts by itself when using flash player for youtube or any other video player. Can't go more than 30 minutes without the computer just restarting when watching vids. Very disappointed would not recommend"
"NEGATIVE", "Motherboard very limited for expansion. Lone PCI x1 slot covered over by video card. Onboard audio is so-so. You must use front panel jacks for 5.1. Powerman PSU is bargain bin."
"NEGATIVE", "Not really any besides Windows 8. It's a little hard to figure out at first, but not nearly as bad as everyone makes it out to be."
"NEGATIVE", "This computer was purchased for the purpose of graphic design and light gaming, however, it has major heat issues. I've had to install a temporary fan to keep the heat under control until a better fix can be made. If you buy this computer you may need to upgrade the cooling system."
"NEGATIVE", "Product Keys for Window 8 does not work, and Avatar has no contact for customer services."
"NEGATIVE", "I've heard the processor and graphics card don't benchmark as well as some of their peers, but for the price I can't really complain..."
"NEGATIVE", "NONE STOP HEADACHE... As soon as I turned it on the GT640 video card was crashing or having errors in the first few moments of running it. I thought I would update the driver from the MSI website for WIN8 64 and it still continuted to act up. Now it's been 2 days and I've gone through all the drivers on the GEFORCE website and still they all crash... I HATE WIN8 and I'm starting to ask WHY they have WIN8 with a card that isn't working correctly with it or even stable!!! AGGGHHHH!!"
"NEGATIVE", "That its discontinued. I wanted to buy another one."
"NEGATIVE", "Windows 8. I despise this system. It is hard to navigate and difficult to get used to, especially when using dual monitors."
"NEGATIVE", "For the price, there's no cons"
"NEGATIVE", "Only one fan however, there's 3 spots that more fans can be put in. Also, if you use a lot of wireless accessories, you might be a little short on USB slots."
"NEGATIVE", "It won't boot windows 8 and then when you put in the recovery disc for windows 8 it ask for a product key and you cant find it anywhere. Plus the number for service does not pick up. I hope I can get this fixed and it will run good..."
"NEGATIVE", "the only real problem i would have with this machine is the choice of graphics card. the 640 has a small memory bus width and would have trouble rending larger texture files. this means that even though the card may be able to render the geometry in games just fine turning textures on high will often result in severe graphical bugs. with nvidia cards the models ending with a 60 such as the 660 or 660ti have a larger buss width the Handel the larger textures and are great all around gaming cards that don't break the bank. or getting one that ends in 70 or 80 will have the bus width to handle the ultra high resolution textures you find when playing games like crysis on ultra."
"NEGATIVE", "Don't know"
